fix: Fix 406 errors and photo preview refresh

Fixed critical issues with skill save and photo display:

1. Fixed 406 Errors on cv_sections ✅
   - Changed .single() to .maybeSingle()
   - Handles "not found" gracefully
   - No more 406 status errors
   - Skill save now works!

2. Fixed Photo Preview Not Showing ✅
   - Fetch photo_url from CV data
   - Pass currentPhotoUrl to PhotoUpload
   - Update state after upload
   - Refresh preview after upload
   - Photo now displays correctly!

3. Auto-Refresh After Upload ✅
   - Call fetchGenerationData() after photo upload
   - Call generatePreview() to refresh preview
   - Update currentPhotoUrl state
   - User sees photo immediately

Technical Changes:
- SkillScoreEditor: Use maybeSingle() instead of single()
- Download page: Add currentPhotoUrl state
- Download page: Fetch photo_url in query
- Download page: Pass photo URL to PhotoUpload
- Download page: Refresh data after upload

Issues Fixed:
- ❌ 406 error on cv_sections SELECT
- ❌ 406 error on cv_sections INSERT check
- ❌ Photo not showing in preview
- ❌ Preview not refreshing after upload
