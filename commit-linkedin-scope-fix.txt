fix: Update LinkedIn OAuth scope and add logging

Changed scope from 'w_member_social r_liteprofile r_emailaddress' 
to 'w_member_social openid profile email' to match LinkedIn app settings.

Also:
- Replaced crypto.randomUUID() with Date.now() for state
- Added detailed logging to debug auth flow
- Log client_id, redirect_uri, and full auth URL

This should fix the "Bummer, something went wrong" error.
