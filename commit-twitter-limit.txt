fix: Enforce Twitter 280 character limit

CRITICAL FIX: Tweets were 332 characters but Twitter limit is 280.
This caused 403 Forbidden errors.

Changes:
- Added character limit check for Twitter
- Smart truncation: removes hashtags first, then content if needed
- Adds back 1-2 hashtags if there's room
- Logs warning when truncating

This will allow tweets to post successfully within Twitter's limits.
