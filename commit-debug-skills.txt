debug: Add console logs to track skill usage

Added console logs to see which skills are being used in the template.
This will help debug why preview is still showing old skills.

Logs will show:
- Whether skillScores are being used
- The actual skill names being displayed
- The final skills array

This will help identify if the issue is:
1. Browser caching old JavaScript
2. Deployment not complete
3. skillScores not being passed correctly
