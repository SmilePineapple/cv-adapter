fix: Add API route for posts to bypass RLS

Posts were being generated but not displayed due to RLS blocking the query.

Solution:
- Created /api/social-bot/posts route with service role key
- Updated page to fetch posts via API instead of direct Supabase query
- Now both configs AND posts bypass RLS properly

The generated tweets will now display in the Scheduled tab.
