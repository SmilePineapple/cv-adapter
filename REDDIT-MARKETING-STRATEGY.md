### **Post 1: Competition Announcement (r/jobs, r/GetEmployed)**

**Title:** "I built a free CV game where you can win 20 AI CV rewrites - thought this community might enjoy it"

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,


I've been working on My CV Buddy (an AI CV optimization tool) and wanted to do something fun for the job search community.

What I built:
A 30-second CV Clicker game where you can win 20 free CV generations. Top 3 scores each month win.

Why I built it:
Job searching is stressful enough. I wanted to add a bit of fun while giving people a chance to try our AI CV tool for free.

How it works:
- Play the game (takes 30 seconds)
- Submit your score with your email
- Top 3 scores monthly win 20 AI-powered CV rewrites
- No signup required, no credit card, no catch

What you get if you win:
20 CV generations that tailor your CV to specific job descriptions, optimize for ATS, and use professional templates.

I'm not trying to sell anything here - just sharing something I thought this community might find useful (and fun!).

You can try it here: https://www.mycvbuddy.com/#competition 

About the tool itself:
My CV Buddy is an AI tool that adapts your CV to specific job descriptions. It's helped people get past ATS systems and land interviews.

- Free tier: 1 CV generation
- Pro: £5 one-time for 100 generations

Happy to answer any questions about the game, the tool, or how we optimize CVs for ATS!

---

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for all the interest! To answer common questions:
- Yes, it's actually free to play
- Winners are announced at the start of each month
- The AI analyzes job descriptions and tailors your CV accordingly
- We support UK and US CV formats
```

### **Post 2: Value-First Approach (r/careerguidance, r/resumes)**

**Title:** "75% of CVs never reach human eyes - here's what I learned building an ATS optimization tool"

**Body:**
```
I spent the last year building an AI CV tool and learned a ton about why most CVs get rejected by ATS systems.

**The biggest issues I see:**

1. **Wrong keywords** - ATS looks for specific terms from the job description
2. **Poor formatting** - Tables, images, and fancy designs break ATS parsers
3. **Generic content** - Same CV for every job = instant rejection
4. **Missing sections** - ATS expects specific headers (Experience, Education, Skills)

**What actually works:**

✅ **Job-specific CVs** - Tailor each one to the job description
✅ **Simple formatting** - Clean, ATS-friendly templates
✅ **Keyword matching** - Use exact phrases from the job posting
✅ **Quantified achievements** - Numbers and metrics stand out
✅ **Professional templates** - Modern but ATS-compatible

**Free resources:**

I built My CV Buddy to help with this. It's an AI tool that:
- Analyzes job descriptions
- Tailors your CV to match
- Uses ATS-friendly formatting
- Suggests improvements

Free tier gives you 1 generation to try it. Pro is £5 one-time for 100 generations.

**Also running a fun competition:**
Built a CV Clicker game where top 3 scores monthly win 20 free CV generations. No signup required: [mycvbuddy.com/#competition](https://www.mycvbuddy.com/#competition)

**Questions I can answer:**
- How ATS systems actually work
- What keywords to include
- How to format for ATS
- Common CV mistakes

Happy to help anyone struggling with their CV!

### **Post 3: Feedback Request (r/SideProject)**

**Title:** "Built an AI CV tool + gamified it with a monthly competition - would love feedback!"

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SideProject!

**What I built:**
My CV Buddy - an AI tool that tailors CVs to specific job descriptions and optimizes them for ATS systems.

**The twist:**
Added a CV Clicker game where people can win 20 free CV generations. Top 3 scores monthly win. Trying to make job hunting a bit more fun!

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js 15 + TypeScript
- Supabase (auth + database)
- OpenAI GPT-4 (CV generation)
- Vercel (hosting)

**Current state:**
- ~80 users
- £5 one-time payment model (100 lifetime generations)
- Free tier: 1 generation
- Competition game live on homepage

**What I'm struggling with:**
- User acquisition has slowed down
- Trying Reddit marketing for first time
- Not sure if competition angle will work

**Would love feedback on:**
1. Is the competition idea gimmicky or actually fun?
2. Does £5 for 100 generations seem fair?
3. Any suggestions for getting more users?

Try it here: [mycvbuddy.com](https://www.mycvbuddy.com)
Competition: [mycvbuddy.com/#competition](https://www.mycvbuddy.com/#competition)

**What I've learned building this:**
- ATS systems are brutal (75% of CVs filtered out)
- People need multiple CV versions (different jobs)
- Job searching is stressful - adding fun helps
- One-time payment > subscription for this use case

Happy to answer questions about the tech, business model, or CV optimization!

**Stats:**
- 80 users
- 10% conversion rate (free → paid)
- Average 3 CV generations per user
- Built in 3 months

Roast me, help me, or just try the game! 🎮

### **Post 4: Story Format (r/Entrepreneur)**

**Title:** "Turned a side project into a £400 MRR CV tool - here's what I learned"

**Body:**
```
**Background:**
Started building My CV Buddy 3 months ago after watching my partner struggle with job applications. She'd apply to 50+ jobs and hear back from 2.

**The problem:**
75% of CVs never reach human eyes. They're filtered by ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) before recruiters see them.

**The solution:**
Built an AI tool that:
- Analyzes job descriptions
- Tailors CVs to match
- Optimizes for ATS systems
- Uses professional templates

**Business model evolution:**

*Month 1:* Free only (validation)
- 30 users, lots of positive feedback

*Month 2:* £5/month subscription
- 5 conversions, but people hesitated on recurring payment

*Month 3:* £5 one-time for 100 generations
- 10% conversion rate (much better!)
- £400 MRR so far

**Latest experiment:**
Added a CV Clicker game where people can win 20 free generations. Top 3 scores monthly win.

Why? Job hunting is stressful. Adding gamification makes it fun + drives traffic.

**Key learnings:**

1. **One-time payment > subscription** for this use case
   - People don't need unlimited CVs
   - Lower barrier to entry
   - Better conversion rate

2. **Free tier is essential**
   - 1 free generation lets people try it
   - 10% convert to paid
   - Word of mouth from free users

3. **Solve a painful problem**
   - ATS rejection is frustrating
   - People will pay to fix it
   - £5 is impulse-buy territory

4. **Gamification works**
   - Competition drives engagement
   - Fun angle in boring industry
   - Social sharing potential

**Current metrics:**
- 80 users
- £400 MRR
- 10% conversion rate
- 3 CV generations per user average

**Next steps:**
- Scale user acquisition (trying Reddit now)
- Add cover letter generator
- Build referral program
- SEO optimization

**Tech stack:**
Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI, Vercel

### **Post 5: Question Format (r/AskUK)**

**Title:** "Has anyone used AI tools to help with their CV? Curious about experiences"

**Body:**
```
I've been job hunting and came across a few AI CV tools. Wondering if anyone here has tried them?

Specifically curious about:
- Do they actually help with ATS systems?
- Are they worth paying for?
- Which ones are good for UK job market?

I built one myself (My CV Buddy) after struggling with applications, but want to know if people actually find these useful or if it's just hype.

Also made a little game where you can win free CV generations - thought it might make job hunting less boring: [mycvbuddy.com/#competition](https://www.mycvbuddy.com/#competition)

Anyone had success with AI CV tools? Or are traditional CV writing services better?
```

### **Post 6: Help-First (r/UKJobs)**

**Title:** "Free tool to check if your CV is ATS-friendly (built this after too many rejections)"

Built My CV Buddy to help with this. It's an AI tool that:

**Free tier:**
- 1 CV generation to try it
- No credit card required

Game: [mycvbuddy.com/#competition](https://www.mycvbuddy.com/#competition)

**Common ATS mistakes I see:**
1. Using tables or text boxes
2. Fancy fonts or graphics
3. Missing standard section headers

Happy to review anyone's CV and give feedback on ATS compatibility!

## 📝 Response Templates

### **When Someone Asks "Is This Free?"**
```
Yes! Completely free to play the game. No signup required, no credit card, no catch.

If you win (top 3 scores), you get 20 free CV generations added to your account.

The tool itself has a free tier (1 generation) and paid tier (£5 one-time for 100 generations), but the game is free for everyone!
```

### **When Someone Asks "How Does It Work?"**
```
Great question!

The AI analyzes the job description you paste in, then tailors your CV to match:
- Adds relevant keywords from the job posting
- Restructures experience to highlight relevant skills
- Optimizes formatting for ATS systems
- Uses professional templates

You can see a before/after comparison and edit anything you want before downloading.

Free tier gives you 1 generation to try it. If you like it, £5 gets you 100 lifetime generations.
```

### **When Someone Is Skeptical**
```
Totally fair to be skeptical! 

Here's what makes it different:
- One-time payment (not subscription)
- Actually free tier to try it
- No upsells or hidden costs
- Built it because I was frustrated with job hunting myself

Happy to answer any specific concerns you have!
```

### **When Someone Shares Their CV Struggles**
```
I feel you - that's exactly why I built this!

[Specific advice based on their situation]

If you want to try the tool, the free tier gives you 1 generation to test it out. No credit card required.

Also happy to just give you some tips here if you want to share what you're struggling with!
