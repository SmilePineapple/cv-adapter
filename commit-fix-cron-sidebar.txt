fix: Fix cron job and dynamic sidebar icons

CRITICAL FIXES:

1. Cron Job Not Running ✅
   Problem: No logs for 14:00 cron execution
   Root Cause: Hobby plan allows only 1 cron job, but 2 were configured
   - Had: social-bot cron + re-engagement cron
   - Hobby limit: 1 cron job only
   - Result: Neither cron was executing
   
   Solution:
   - Removed re-engagement cron from vercel.json
   - Kept only social-bot cron at 14:00 UTC
   - Now within Hobby plan limits
   
   Impact:
   ✅ Social bot cron will now execute at 14:00 UTC
   ✅ LinkedIn and Twitter posts will auto-post
   ✅ Scheduled posts will be published on time
   
   Next Deployment:
   - Vercel will update cron configuration
   - Cron will start executing at next 14:00 UTC
   - Check Vercel dashboard for execution logs

2. Sidebar Icon Alignment ✅
   Problem: Hardcoded static icons didn't align with sections
   - Icons: 👤 💼 🎓 ⚡ 🎯 (always same 5)
   - Sections: Variable based on CV content
   - Result: Icons didn't match actual sections
   
   Solution:
   - Made icons dynamic based on sections present
   - Check which sections have content
   - Generate icons array accordingly
   - Icons now match sections 1:1
   
   Icon Mapping:
   - 👤 Profile (always first)
   - 💼 Work Experience (if present)
   - 🎓 Education (if present)
   - ⚡ Skills (if present)
   - 📜 Certifications (if present)
   - 🌐 Languages (if present)
   - 🎯 Hobbies (if present)
   
   Impact:
   ✅ Icons align with sections
   ✅ Only shows icons for sections that exist
   ✅ Professional, clean appearance
   ✅ Icons have tooltips for accessibility

Changes Made:
- vercel.json:
  * Removed re-engagement cron
  * Kept only social-bot cron
  * Now within Hobby plan 1-cron limit
  
- src/lib/stunning-templates.ts:
  * Added dynamic icon generation
  * Check data.experience, data.education, etc.
  * Build sectionIcons array
  * Map icons to HTML with tooltips
  * Icons now match sections present

Impact:
✅ Cron will execute at 14:00 UTC
✅ Social posts will auto-publish
✅ Sidebar icons align with sections
✅ Professional template appearance

Testing:
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Wait for next 14:00 UTC
3. Check Vercel cron logs for execution
4. Verify posts are published to LinkedIn/Twitter
5. Check Teal Sidebar template - icons should align

Status: Build passing, ready to deploy!
