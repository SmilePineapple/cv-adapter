} from '@/lib/conversion-tracking'

// After signup

// After first upload
trackFirstUpload(userId)

// After first generation
trackFirstGeneration(userId)

// When upgrade button clicked
trackClickedUpgrade('dashboard', 'usage_tracker')

// When checkout starts
trackStartedCheckout(userId)

// When payment completes
