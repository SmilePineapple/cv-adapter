**Date**: October 24, 2025, 9:42am

---

## 🐛 **LATEST ISSUES FOUND:**

### **1. Fake Job Created AGAIN**

### **2. Education Modified AGAIN**
```

- PDF shows empty "CERTIFICATIONS" section

### **4. Hobbies Only Shows 2 Keywords**

**File**: `src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts` (Lines 343-358)

**Added**:
```
🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - FAILURE = REJECTED OUTPUT 🚨🚨🚨

THIS IS A CV ADAPTATION TASK, NOT A CV CREATION TASK!

YOU MUST PRESERVE:

YOU CAN ONLY CHANGE:
✏️ Bullet points describing job responsibilities

```

### **Fix #2: Enhanced Fake Company Detection**

### **Fix #3: Job Count Validation**
**File**: `src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts` (Lines 196-206)

**Added**:
```typescript
// Count job entries in original vs rewritten
const originalJobCount = (originalContent.match(/\|\s*[A-Z]/g) || []).length
const rewrittenJobCount = (rewrittenContent.match(/\|\s*[A-Z]/g) || []).length

if (rewrittenJobCount < originalJobCount) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: `AI removed ${originalJobCount - rewrittenJobCount} job(s)` 
  }, { status: 500 })
}
```

### **Fix #4: Education Validation**
**File**: `src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts` (Lines 226-261)

**Added**:
```typescript
// Detect fake education entries
const fakeEducationPatterns = [
  'Bachelor of Arts in English Literature',
  'University of London',
  'Bachelor of Arts in [',
  '[Relevant Field]'
]

if (detectedFakeEducation.length > 0) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: `AI modified education with fake entries` 
  }, { status: 500 })
}
```

### **Fix #5: Pre-Flight Checklist**

## 🧪 **TESTING REQUIRED:**

### **Test 1: Generate New CV**
1. Delete the bad generation
2. Generate fresh CV (Pamela → Content Writer)
3. **Verify**: No "XYZ Company" in experience ✅
4. **Verify**: No "Bachelor of Arts in English Literature" in education ✅
5. **Verify**: All 6 original jobs preserved ✅

### **Test 2: Check Validation Logs**
Look for console output:
```
📋 Original companies detected: Child in Mind, Barnardos, OJs, ...
✅ Validation passed: 100% of companies preserved
✅ Education validation passed
```

### **Test 3: Check Error Handling**
If AI still creates fake content, should see:
```
🚨 CRITICAL: AI invented fake companies: XYZ Company
Error: AI generated invalid content - invented fake companies
```

## ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUES:**

### **1. PDF Export - Certifications Empty**
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Likely cause**: Export template not rendering certifications
- **Fix needed**: Check template HTML generation

### **2. PDF Export - Hobbies Shows Keywords Only**
- **Status**: Known issue in advanced templates
- **Cause**: `detectHobbies()` extracts keywords instead of full text
- **Fix needed**: Modify advanced templates to show full text
