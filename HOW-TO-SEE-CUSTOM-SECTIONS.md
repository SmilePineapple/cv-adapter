## 🔍 **WHY CUSTOM SECTIONS AREN'T SHOWING YET:**

You're looking at an **OLD generation** that was created **BEFORE** the AI prompt fix was applied!

**Timeline**:
- ⏰ **10:39am**: AI prompt fix deployed (added custom section types)
- ⏰ **10:51am**: Advanced templates fix deployed (education/certifications rendering)
- ⏰ **11:11am**: You're viewing a generation created at **9:36am** (before the fix!)

**The generation you're viewing** was created at 9:36am, which is **BEFORE** the AI knew about custom sections!

## 🔍 **HOW TO VERIFY THE FIX WORKED:**

### **Check Terminal Logs**
After generating, look for:
```
✅ Education validation passed
📊 Keyword Match: X/20 = X points
📋 Section Completeness: 20 points
...
```

If you see errors like:
```
❌ Missing custom sections: volunteer_work, publications, ...
```

Then the AI didn't include them. But with the fix, you should see them in the output!

### **Check AI Output**
The AI should return JSON with ALL sections:
```json
{
  "sections": [
    {"type": "name", "content": "...", "order": 1},
    {"type": "contact", "content": "...", "order": 2},
    {"type": "summary", "content": "...", "order": 3},
    {"type": "experience", "content": "...", "order": 4},
    {"type": "education", "content": "...", "order": 5},
    {"type": "skills", "content": "...", "order": 6},
    {"type": "certifications", "content": "...", "order": 7},
    {"type": "volunteer_work", "content": "...", "order": 8},
    {"type": "publications", "content": "...", "order": 9},
    {"type": "awards", "content": "...", "order": 10},
    {"type": "projects", "content": "...", "order": 11},
    {"type": "languages", "content": "...", "order": 12},
    {"type": "memberships", "content": "...", "order": 13},
    {"type": "speaking", "content": "...", "order": 14},
    {"type": "patents", "content": "...", "order": 15},
    {"type": "research", "content": "...", "order": 16},
    {"type": "teaching", "content": "...", "order": 17},
    {"type": "community", "content": "...", "order": 18}
  ]
}
```

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES:**

### **1. Custom Sections Must Exist in Original CV**
If you add a custom section name (e.g., "Volunteer Work") but don't have any content for it in your original CV, it will appear empty in the output!

**Make sure your original CV has content for each custom section you want to include!**

### **2. Custom Sections Are Preserved, Not Adapted**
Custom sections are treated like education/certifications:
- ✅ Content copied 100% exactly
- ❌ NOT adapted for new job
- ❌ NOT modified by AI

This is correct! Custom sections should remain constant.

### **3. Section Names Are Converted**
The AI uses underscores (`volunteer_work`), but the UI displays them with spaces:
- `volunteer_work` → "Volunteer Work"
- `professional_memberships` → "Professional Memberships"
- `community_involvement` → "Community Involvement"

---
