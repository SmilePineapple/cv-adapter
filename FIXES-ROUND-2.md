# üö® CRITICAL FIXES - Round 2 (October 22, 2025)

## Issues Reported & Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ **Only 1 Work Experience Showing (Should Be 6)**

**Issue:** AI rewrite was only generating 1 work experience even though Pamela's CV has 6 different jobs.

**Root Cause:** 
- `truncateContent()` function was limiting each section to 200 characters
- This meant only the first work experience fit in the prompt
- AI never saw the other 5 work experiences

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before: Truncated to 200 chars per section
const sectionsText = sections
  .map(s => `${s.type}: ${truncateContent(s.content, 200)}`)
  .join('\n')

// After: NO truncation - send ALL content
const sectionsText = sections
  .map(s => {
    const content = typeof s.content === 'string' ? s.content : JSON.stringify(s.content)
    return `${s.type}:\n${content}`
  })
  .join('\n\n')
```

**Additional Changes:**
- Increased `max_tokens` from 2000 to 4000 (to handle 6+ work experiences)
- Updated prompt to emphasize "INCLUDE EVERY WORK EXPERIENCE"
- Added "Do NOT skip or merge any jobs - include ALL of them"

**File Modified:** `src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts`

**Expected Result:** All 6 work experiences now appear in generated CV

### 2. ‚úÖ **Pro Users Still Seeing "Free Improvement Used" Message**

**Issue:** Pro users clicking "Apply All Improvements" got error: "You have already used your free AI improvement. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited improvements!"

**Root Cause:** The `apply-improvements` API was checking for free improvement usage WITHOUT checking if user is Pro.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before: Checked for ALL users
const { data: existingImprovement } = await supabase
  .from('ai_improvements')
  .select('id')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single()

if (existingImprovement) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'You have already used your free AI improvement...' 
  }, { status: 403 })
}

// After: Only check for free users
const { data: usage } = await supabase
  .from('usage_tracking')
  .select('plan_type')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single()

if (usage?.plan_type === 'free') {
  const { data: existingImprovement } = await supabase
    .from('ai_improvements')
    .select('id')
    .eq('user_id', user.id)
    .single()

  if (existingImprovement) {
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      error: 'You have already used your free AI improvement...' 
    }, { status: 403 })
  }
}
// Pro users have unlimited improvements - no check needed
```

**Also Fixed Tracking:**
```typescript
// Only track for free users
if (usage?.plan_type === 'free') {
  await supabase
    .from('ai_improvements')
    .insert({
      user_id: user.id,
      generation_id,
      improvements_applied: improvements,
      missing_sections_added: missing_sections,
      keywords_added: keywords
    })
}
```

**File Modified:** `src/app/api/apply-improvements/route.ts`

**Expected Result:** Pro users can apply improvements unlimited times

---

### 3. ‚úÖ **Database Error: layout Column Missing**

**Issue:** Vercel logs showed:
```
Error creating CV sections: {
  code: 'PGRST204',
  message: "Could not find the 'layout' column of 'cv_sections' in the schema cache"
}
```

**Root Cause:** Upload API was trying to insert `layout` column that doesn't exist in `cv_sections` table.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before: Tried to insert non-existent layout column
const sectionsToInsert = parsedSections.sections.map((section, index) => ({
  cv_id: cvData.id,
  user_id: userId,
  section_type: mapSectionType(section.type),
  raw_content: section.content,
  content: section.content,
  order_index: index,
  layout: 'left' as const  // ‚ùå Column doesn't exist
}))

// After: Removed layout field
const sectionsToInsert = parsedSections.sections.map((section, index) => ({
  cv_id: cvData.id,
  user_id: userId,
  section_type: mapSectionType(section.type),
  raw_content: section.content,
  content: section.content,
  order_index: index
  // Removed layout field - doesn't exist in database
}))
```

**File Modified:** `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`

**Expected Result:** No more database errors on CV upload

---

### 4. ‚úÖ **Enhanced AI Prompt for Better Content Preservation**

**Issue:** Generated CVs were "cleaning out" content and making it "much denser" with "very little stuff"

**Fix:** Updated AI rewrite prompt to emphasize preserving ALL content:

```typescript
CRITICAL RULES:
1. PRESERVE ALL: Names, contacts, dates, companies, job titles, ALL work experiences
2. INCLUDE EVERY WORK EXPERIENCE: Do NOT skip or merge any jobs - include ALL of them
3. ENHANCE: ${styleMap[rewriteStyle]} to experience descriptions
4. TONE: ${tone}
5. LANGUAGE: ${languageName}

FOCUS AREAS:
- Summary: 3-4 sentences, highlight ${keywords.slice(0, 3).join(', ')}
- Experience: Include EVERY job listed, 4-5 bullets per role, add metrics, use action verbs
- Skills: Include ALL skills, prioritize job-relevant ones
- Education: Include ALL qualifications
- Certifications: Include ALL certifications and licenses
- Keep hobbies, groups, strengths, additional info unchanged
```

**File Modified:** `src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts`

**Expected Result:** Generated CVs preserve all content from original

---

## Remaining Issues (To Be Fixed Next)

### 5. ‚è≥ **Empty Education & Certifications Sections**

**Status:** Partially fixed by AI parsing improvements, but may need additional work

**Next Steps:**
- Test with Pamela's CV again
- If still empty, enhance AI parsing prompt further
- May need to increase max_tokens in upload API

### 6. ‚è≥ **Hobbies Only Showing 2 Icons**

**Status:** Need to investigate hobby detection logic

**Next Steps:**
- Check `detectHobbies()` function in advanced templates
- Ensure all hobbies from CV are being detected
- May need to expand hobby keyword list

### 7. ‚è≥ **Hobby Selector 404 Error**

**Status:** Need to create missing route

**Next Steps:**
- Check if `/hobbies/[id]` route exists
- Create route if missing
- Or remove hobby selector button if not needed

### 8. ‚è≥ **AI Review on Download Page Doesn't Allow Applying Improvements**

**Status:** Need to investigate download page implementation

**Next Steps:**
- Check download page code
- Ensure "Apply Improvements" button is present
- May need to add functionality
