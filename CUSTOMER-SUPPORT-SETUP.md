## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Chat not appearing?
1. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` is set
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Crisp script is loading

### Chat appearing on wrong pages?
Add conditional rendering:
```typescript
const pathname = usePathname()
const showChat = !pathname.startsWith('/admin')

if (!showChat) return null
```

### Performance issues?
Crisp loads asynchronously and won't block page load. If concerned:
- Load only on specific pages
- Delay load until user interaction
- Use Crisp's lazy loading option
