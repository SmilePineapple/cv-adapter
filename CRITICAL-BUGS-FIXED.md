# 🐛 CRITICAL BUGS FIXED!

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Time**: 3:35pm  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🚨 **BUG 1: Edit Button Not Working**

### **Problem**:
- Clicking "Edit" on a generation showed: "Failed to prepare CV for editing"
- User was redirected to `/history` page

### **Root Cause**:
- Edit button was linking to `/edit/${generation.cv_id}`
- If the original CV was deleted, `cv_id` would be `NULL`
- Link would become `/edit/null` which fails
- Migration API `/api/cv/${cvId}/migrate` would fail

### **Fix Applied** ✅:
- Added conditional check: `generation.cv_id ? <Link> : <DisabledButton>`
- If CV exists → Show working Edit button
- If CV deleted (orphaned) → Show disabled button with tooltip
- Tooltip says: "Original CV was deleted"

### **File Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Lines 1175-1192

## 🚨 **BUG 2: Wrong View Page for Generations**

### **Problem**:
- Clicking "View" on a CV generation showed: "Failed to load interview prep"
- Error: `Error fetching prep: {}`
- User was taken to interview prep view page instead of CV review page

### **Root Cause**:
- Dashboard Generations tab "View" button was linking to `/interview-prep/view/${generation.id}`
- Should have been linking to `/review/${generation.id}`
- Interview prep view page tried to fetch from `interview_preps` table
- Generation ID doesn't exist in that table → Error

### **Fix Applied** ✅:
- Changed link from `/interview-prep/view/${generation.id}` to `/review/${generation.id}`
- Now correctly opens the CV review page
- Shows the generated CV content

### **File Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Line 1169

## ✅ **WHAT NOW WORKS**

### **Generations Tab**:
1. ✅ **View Button** → Opens `/review/${id}` (CV review page)
2. ✅ **Edit Button** → Opens `/edit/${cv_id}` (if CV exists)
3. ✅ **Edit Button** → Disabled with tooltip (if CV deleted)
4. ✅ **Download Button** → Opens `/download/${id}`
5. ✅ **Delete Button** → Deletes generation

### **Interview Prep Tab**:
1. ✅ **View Button** → Opens `/interview-prep/view/${id}` (interview prep page)
2. ✅ **Delete Button** → Deletes interview prep
