fix: Remove br tags from PromoEmail causing React Email render error

Fixed TypeError: b is not a function by:
- Removing br tags and splitting into separate Text components
- Removing unused Img import
- Following same pattern as working email templates

The error was caused by br tags not being properly handled by React Email in production build.
