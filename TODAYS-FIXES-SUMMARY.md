# 🎉 Today's Fixes Summary - Oct 22, 2025

## ✅ **MAJOR FIX: CASCADE Delete Issue - RESOLVED**

### The Problem
Generations appeared to be deleted when CV was deleted.

### Root Cause
- Database constraint was correctly set to `SET NULL` ✅
- BUT queries used `INNER JOIN` which filtered out orphaned generations ❌
- Result: Generations preserved in database but hidden from UI

### The Fix
1. **Dashboard Query**: Changed from `cvs!inner(file_meta)` to `cvs(file_meta)`
2. **Review Page**: Handle NULL cv_id gracefully
3. **Download Page**: Handle NULL cv_id gracefully

### Files Modified
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `src/app/review/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/download/[id]/page.tsx`

### Result
- ✅ Generations preserved when CV deleted
- ✅ Orphaned generations visible in dashboard
- ✅ Can view and download orphaned generations
- ✅ Appropriate buttons disabled for orphaned ones

## ✅ **FIX: AI Creating Fake Jobs - VALIDATION ADDED**

### The Problem
AI was inventing fake companies like "Springer Nature" instead of keeping real ones like "Child in Mind".

### The Fix
Added strict validation in `/api/rewrite`:
- Extracts original companies from CV
- Detects fake companies (Springer Nature, etc.)
- Rejects AI output if fake companies detected
- Rejects if <70% of companies preserved

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts`

### Result
- ✅ AI output rejected if fake companies detected
- ✅ User can retry generation
- ✅ Eventually AI follows rules

## ✅ **FIX: AI Improvements Decreasing ATS Score**

### The Problem
AI improvements were removing keywords, causing ATS score to decrease (68% → 45%).

### The Fix
Enhanced prompt in `/api/apply-improvements`:
- Explicit "ADD keywords, don't REMOVE" instructions
- "PRESERVE all existing keywords"
- "ATS score MUST increase"

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/apply-improvements/route.ts`

### Result
- ✅ Prompt emphasizes keyword preservation
- ✅ Safeguard still rejects bad improvements
- ⏳ Monitoring effectiveness

---

## ✅ **FIX: Modal Auto-Close After Improvements**

### The Problem
AI review modal stayed open after applying improvements.

### The Fix
Added `setShowReview(false)` after successful improvement application.

### Files Modified
- `src/app/review/[id]/page.tsx`

### Result
- ✅ Modal closes automatically
- ✅ Comparison view appears
- ✅ Smooth scroll to comparison

---

## ✅ **FIX: Templates Restored**

### The Problem
Only 8 templates showing instead of 14.

### The Fix
Added back 12 modern templates while keeping 2 advanced templates.

### Files Modified
- `src/app/download/[id]/page.tsx`

### Templates Now Available (14 total)
**Advanced (2):**
1. ✨ Creative Modern (PREMIUM)
2. ✨ Professional Columns (PREMIUM)
