## 📁 FILES CREATED

### **1. Job Scraping API** (`src/app/api/jobs/scrape/route.ts`)
**What it does**:
- Accepts job posting URL
- Fetches HTML from URL
- Uses OpenAI to extract structured data
- Returns: title, company, location, description, requirements, salary, job type, remote status
- Gates: Free = 3 scrapes, Pro = unlimited
- Tracks usage in database

### **2. Job Scraper Component** (`src/components/JobScraper.tsx`)
**What it does**:
- Beautiful UI with job URL input
- "Extract" button to scrape
- Shows scraped job preview with badges
- Auto-fills form fields
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Upgrade prompts for free users

### **3. Database Migration** (`migrations/add-job-scrapes.sql`)
**What it does**:
- Adds `job_scrapes_used` column to `usage_tracking`
- Defaults to 0 for existing users

---

## 🔧 FILES MODIFIED

### **Generate Page** (`src/app/generate/[id]/page.tsx`)
**Changes**:
- Imported JobScraper component
- Added JobScraper before form
- Auto-fills `jobTitle` and `jobDescription` when job scraped

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

5. **API processes**:
   - Fetches HTML
   - Extracts with OpenAI
   - Returns structured data

7. **Preview shows**:
   - Company name

## 🧪 TESTING GUIDE

ALTER TABLE usage_tracking 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS job_scrapes_used INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

UPDATE usage_tracking 
SET job_scrapes_used = 0 
WHERE job_scrapes_used IS NULL;
```

### **Step 2: Start Dev Server**

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Test Job Scraping**

1. Upload a CV
2. Go to generate page
3. Paste a job URL (examples below)

- Glassdoor: `https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/job-listing/...`

### **Step 4: Test Gating**
