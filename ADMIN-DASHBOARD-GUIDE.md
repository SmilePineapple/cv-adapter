## API Endpoints

**Endpoint**: `/api/admin/analytics`
**Method**: GET
**Auth**: Requires admin email authentication

**Returns**:
```json
{
  "overview": {
    "totalUsers": 150,
    "freeUsers": 120,
    "proUsers": 30,
    "totalGenerations": 450,
    "totalCVs": 180,
    "totalCoverLetters": 75,
    "newUsersLast7Days": 12,
    "newUsersLast30Days": 45,
    "activeUsers": 80,
    "totalRevenue": 150,
    "conversionRate": "20.00",
    "avgGenerationsPerUser": "3.00"
  },
  "charts": {
    "generationsByDay": { "2025-01-15": 12, ... },
    "signupsByDay": { "2025-01-15": 3, ... }
  },
  "users": [...],
  "topUsers": [...]
}
```

### Upgrade User API
**Endpoint**: `/api/admin/upgrade-user`
**Method**: POST
**Auth**: Requires admin email authentication

**Body**:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  // OR
  "userId": "uuid-here"
}
```

## Security

### Authentication
- Only emails in `ADMIN_EMAILS` array can access admin features
- Currently configured: `['jakedalerourke@gmail.com']`
- Uses Supabase service role key for elevated permissions
- All API calls require valid admin session token

### Adding More Admins
To add additional admin users, update the `ADMIN_EMAILS` constant in:
1. `/src/app/admin/page.tsx` (line 8)
2. `/src/app/admin/upgrade-user/page.tsx` (line 8)
3. `/src/app/api/admin/analytics/route.ts` (line 4)
4. `/src/app/api/admin/upgrade-user/route.ts` (line 4)

Example:
```typescript
const ADMIN_EMAILS = ['jakedalerourke@gmail.com', 'admin2@example.com']
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Admin API uses Supabase service role key to bypass RLS
- Regular users cannot access admin endpoints
- Unauthorized access attempts redirect to dashboard

## Database Queries

The admin dashboard queries the following tables:
- `auth.users` - User accounts
- `profiles` - User profiles and activity
- `purchases` - One-time payment records (lifetime access)
- `subscriptions` - Legacy subscription data (backward compatibility)
- `usage_tracking` - Generation usage tracking with lifetime counts
- `generations` - CV generation history
- `cvs` - Uploaded CVs
- `cover_letters` - Cover letter creations

**Note**: The system supports both the new `purchases` table (lifetime payments) and legacy `subscriptions` table for backward compatibility.

## Key Metrics Explained

### Conversion Rate
Percentage of total users who have upgraded to Pro
```
(Pro Users / Total Users) √ó 100
```

### Average Generations Per User

```
