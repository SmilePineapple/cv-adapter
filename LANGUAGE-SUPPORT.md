# Multi-Language Support Implementation

## Overview

CV Adapter now automatically detects the language of uploaded CVs and generates all AI content (CV rewrites and cover letters) in the **same language** as the original document. This enables users from around the world to use the platform in their native language without any additional configuration.

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Language Detection**
- When a user uploads a CV, the system automatically detects the language using the `franc-min` library
- Supports **50+ languages** including:
  - **European**: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Czech, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Greek
  - **Asian**: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay, Filipino
  - **Middle Eastern & South Asian**: Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi
  - **Slavic**: Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech
- Language is stored in the database with the CV record

### 2. **Language-Aware AI Generation**
- When generating CV rewrites or cover letters, the system:
  1. Retrieves the detected language from the CV
  2. Adds specific language instructions to the AI prompt
  3. Ensures OpenAI generates **all output in the same language**
- No translation occurs - the AI writes natively in the detected language

### 3. **Visual Language Indicators**
- Language badges appear on the dashboard for non-English documents
- Color-coded by language family:
  - **Blue**: European languages
  - **Purple**: Asian languages
  - **Amber**: Middle Eastern & South Asian languages
  - **Green**: Slavic languages

## Database Changes

### New Columns Added

```sql
-- CVs table
ALTER TABLE cvs ADD COLUMN detected_language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en';

-- Generations table
ALTER TABLE generations ADD COLUMN output_language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en';

-- Cover letters table
ALTER TABLE cover_letters ADD COLUMN output_language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en';
```

### Migration Script
Run `add-language-support.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to add language support to existing installations.

## API Changes

### Upload API (`/api/upload`)
**New Response Fields:**
```json
{
  "detected_language": {
    "code": "fr",
    "name": "French",
    "confidence": "high"
  }
}
```

### Rewrite API (`/api/rewrite`)
- Automatically fetches `detected_language` from CV
- Passes language to AI prompt
- Saves `output_language` with generation

### Cover Letter API (`/api/cover-letter/generate`)
- Automatically fetches `detected_language` from CV
- Generates cover letter in same language
- Saves `output_language` with cover letter

## User Experience

### For English Users
- No change in experience
- System works exactly as before

### For Non-English Users
- Upload CV in their native language (e.g., French, Arabic, Hindi)
- System automatically detects language
- All generated content (CV rewrites, cover letters) is in the same language
- Language badge shows on dashboard for easy identification

## Technical Implementation

### Language Detection Utility (`src/lib/language-detection.ts`)
```typescript
import { detectLanguage } from '@/lib/language-detection'

const result = detectLanguage(text)
// Returns: { code: 'fr', name: 'French', confidence: 'high' }
```

### Language Badge Component (`src/components/LanguageBadge.tsx`)
```tsx
import { LanguageBadge } from '@/components/LanguageBadge'

<LanguageBadge languageCode="fr" showIcon={true} />
```

### AI Prompt Enhancement
```typescript
const languageInstruction = getLanguageInstruction(detectedLanguage)
// Returns: "CRITICAL: Generate ALL output in French. Do not translate to English."
```
