## ⏳ **CURRENT STATUS: WAITING FOR APPROVAL**

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS (While Waiting)**

SET 
  api_key = 'YOUR_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID',
  api_secret = 'YOUR_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET',
  account_username = 'CV Adapter',
  enabled = TRUE,
  posting_enabled = FALSE,
  daily_post_limit = 5
WHERE platform = 'linkedin';
```

**Replace with your actual credentials from LinkedIn Developer App**

### **Step 2: Start Using Manual Posting** (Now!)

Even without API approval, you can:
1. ✅ Generate LinkedIn content with AI

2. Click on your app
3. Go to "Auth" tab
4. Under "Redirect URLs", add:
   ```
   https://www.mycvbuddy.com/api/auth/linkedin/callback
   ```
5. Click "Update"

### **Step 2: Complete OAuth Flow**

You'll need to authenticate once to get an access token:

1. Visit: `https://www.mycvbuddy.com/admin/social-bot/linkedin-auth`
2. Click "Connect LinkedIn"
3. Authorize the app
4. Token will be saved automatically

### **Step 3: Enable Automated Posting**

SET posting_enabled = TRUE
WHERE platform = 'linkedin';
```

### **Step 4: Test Posting**
