fix: Bypass RLS for social bot config by using API route

The social bot page wasn't showing platform cards because RLS policies were blocking the config query.

Solution:
- Created /api/social-bot/config route that uses service role key
- Updated page to fetch configs via API instead of direct Supabase query
- Added error logging for debugging
- This bypasses RLS while maintaining security through API route

Now the platform cards with "Generate Week" buttons will display properly.
