### Post 5: Storytelling Format
```
A few weeks ago, I was talking to a job seeker who said:

"I've applied to 50 jobs and heard back from 2. I don't know what I'm doing wrong."

The issue? Her CV wasn't optimized for ATS systems. It was getting filtered out before anyone read it.

**This is why we built My CV Buddy.**

And now, we're making it accessible to more people through our monthly competition.

**Here's how it works:**

Play our CV Clicker game (it's actually pretty fun - think Cookie Clicker meets job hunting).

Top 3 scores each month win 20 FREE CV generations.

That means 20 different versions of your CV, each one:
→ Tailored to a specific job description
→ Optimized for ATS systems
→ Professionally formatted
→ Ready to send

**Why we're doing this:**

Because job hunting is hard enough. And everyone deserves a CV that actually gets seen.

No signup required. Just 30 seconds of your time and a valid email address.

Winners announced at the start of each month.
