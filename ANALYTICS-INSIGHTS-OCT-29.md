## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES NEEDED

### 1. Vercel Cron Issue
**Problem**: Hobby plan only allows daily crons, not hourly
**Solution**: Keep daily cron at 2 PM UTC OR upgrade to Vercel Pro ($20/month)

### 2. Analytics Tracking
**Problem**: Low event tracking (from previous memory)
**Solution**: Implement tracking in all key pages:
```typescript
// Add to each page
trackEvent('page_view', { page: 'dashboard' })
trackEvent('cv_upload', { file_type: 'pdf' })
trackEvent('generation_start', { job_title: 'Software Engineer' })
trackEvent('generation_complete', { success: true })
trackEvent('upgrade_click', { source: 'dashboard_banner' })
```

### 3. User Onboarding
**Problem**: No guidance for new users
**Solution**: Create onboarding flow component
