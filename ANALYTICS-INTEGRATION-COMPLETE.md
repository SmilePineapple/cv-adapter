# ✅ Analytics Integration - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

**Issue:** Analytics dashboard shows no data even though users are signing up and using the platform.

**Root Cause:** Analytics tracking was set up but never integrated into the APIs. The `analytics_events` table was empty.

**Solution:** 
1. ✅ Backfill historical data from existing tables
2. ✅ Integrate tracking into all key APIs
3. ✅ Track new events going forward

---

## 📊 What's Now Tracked

### Events Being Tracked:
1. **CV Uploads** - When users upload CVs
2. **CV Generations** - When AI generates tailored CVs
3. **Cover Letter Generations** - When users create cover letters
4. **Payments** - When users upgrade to Pro
5. **Exports** - When users download CVs (ready to add)

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Backfill Historical Data

### Run This SQL in Supabase

**File:** `backfill-analytics-data.sql`

This script will:
- Import all existing CV uploads from `cvs` table
- Import all CV generations from `generations` table
- Import all cover letters from `cover_letters` table
- Import all payments from `purchases` table
- Refresh the materialized view

**To Run:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `backfill-analytics-data.sql`
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify results at bottom of script

**Expected Output:**
```
event_type                  | count | earliest            | latest
cv_generation              | 50    | 2024-09-01          | 2025-10-20
cv_upload                  | 30    | 2024-09-01          | 2025-10-20
cover_letter_generation    | 20    | 2024-10-01          | 2025-10-20
payment_completed          | 5     | 2024-09-15          | 2025-10-15
```

## 🚀 Step 2: Tracking Integrated into APIs

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **Upload API** ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`

**What it tracks:**
- Detected language
- File name
- File size

**Code added:**
```typescript
import { trackCVUpload } from '@/lib/analytics'

// After successful CV save
await trackCVUpload(languageResult.code, file.name)
```

#### 2. **Generation API** ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts`

**What it tracks:**
- Job title
- Output language
- Rewrite style
- Tone
- ATS score

**Code added:**
```typescript
import { trackCVGeneration } from '@/lib/analytics'

// After successful generation
await trackCVGeneration({
  jobTitle: job_title,
  outputLanguage: detectedLanguage,
  rewriteStyle: rewrite_style,
  tone
})
```

#### 3. **Payment Webhook** ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`

**What it tracks:**
- Payment amount
- Plan type (Pro)
- Currency

**Code added:**
```typescript
import { trackPaymentCompleted } from '@/lib/analytics'

// After successful payment
await trackPaymentCompleted(session.amount_total || 0, 'pro')

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### For New Events:

1. **User uploads CV**
   → Upload API saves to `cvs` table
   → Tracking API saves to `analytics_events` table
   → Analytics dashboard updates

2. **User generates CV**
   → Generation API saves to `generations` table
   → Tracking API saves to `analytics_events` table
   → Analytics dashboard updates

3. **User pays for Pro**
   → Stripe webhook saves to `purchases` table
   → Tracking API saves to `analytics_events` table
   → Analytics dashboard updates

### Data Flow:
```
User Action → API Route → Database Table → Analytics Event → Dashboard
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still No Data After Backfill

**Check:**

2. Check query results at bottom of script
3. Verify data in `analytics_events` table:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM analytics_events;
   ```

### Issue: New Events Not Tracking

**Check:**
1. Are there any errors in API logs?
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify tracking functions are being called:
   ```typescript
   console.log('Tracking event:', eventType, eventData)
   ```

### Issue: Dashboard Shows Wrong Numbers

**Refresh materialized view:**
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_stats;
```
