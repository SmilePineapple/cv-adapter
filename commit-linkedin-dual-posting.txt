feat: Post to BOTH personal LinkedIn profile AND company page

Changed LinkedIn posting strategy:
1. Always post to personal profile (guaranteed to work)
2. Optionally try to post to company page (if organization_id set)
3. If company posting fails, continue anyway (personal post succeeds)

This gives maximum reach:
- Personal profile (your followers)
- Company page (if permissions allow)

Benefits:
- Leverages personal follower base
- Attempts company page posting
- Doesn't fail if company posting is denied
- Best of both worlds!
