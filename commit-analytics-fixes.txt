fix: Prevent analytics dashboard errors during auth check

Fixed JavaScript errors on analytics-v2 page:
- Added null checks for toFixed() calls on conversion_rate, avg_usage_per_user, and retention_rate
- Added isCheckingAuth state to prevent rendering before auth completes
- Added loading spinner during auth check
- Prevents "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toFixed')" errors

This ensures the page doesn't try to render data before:
1. Auth check completes
2. Data is loaded from database
