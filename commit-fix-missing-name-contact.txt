fix: Always include name and contact sections from original CV

CRITICAL FIX: The AI generation doesn't always include name and contact 
sections in output_sections, causing "Your Name" and empty contact info 
to display in exports and previews.

Root Cause (from logs):
- Export sections: summary, experience, education, skills, etc.
- Missing: name, contact
- Result: Templates show "Your Name" and empty contact fields

Solution:
1. Export API: Check if name/contact missing from AI output
2. If missing, fetch from original CV parsed_sections
3. Add to beginning of sections array
4. Preview: Same logic to ensure preview matches export

Changes:
- src/app/api/export/route.ts: Add name/contact from original if missing
- src/app/download/[id]/page.tsx: Add name/contact to preview if missing

Impact:
âœ… User's actual name will display (not "Your Name")
âœ… Contact info (email, phone, location) will display
âœ… Preview and export will match
âœ… All templates will show correct personal info

Logs will show:
- "âœ… Adding name section from original CV"
- "âœ… Adding contact section from original CV"
- "ðŸ“‹ Has name section: true"
- "ðŸ“‹ Has contact section: true"

Status: Build passing, ready to deploy!
