# ✅ ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED!

**Date**: October 24, 2025, 10:28am  
**Status**: 🎉 **ALL FIXES DEPLOYED!**

---

## 🎯 **ISSUES RESOLVED:**

### **1. ✅ Education & Certifications Empty in Download Page**
**Root Cause**: Download page had its own outdated copy of `getSectionContent()` that only handled work experience!

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `src/app/download/[id]/page.tsx` (Lines 68-161)
- Added support for education field names: `degree`, `institution`, `date`, `location`
- Added support for certification field names: `name`, `issuer`, `license`, `url`
- Added recursive string extraction for nested objects

**Result**: ✅ Download page now shows education and certifications correctly!

---

### **2. ✅ Dashboard Stuck at 20 Generations**
**Root Cause**: Dashboard queries had `.limit(20)` hardcoded!

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `.limit(20)` from generations query (Line 255)
- Removed `.limit(20)` from cover letters query (Line 276)
- Removed `.limit(20)` from interview preps query (Line 302)

**Result**: ✅ Dashboard now shows ALL generations, not just 20!

---

### **3. ✅ Work Experience Bullet Points**
**Status**: Already fixed in previous session!
- AI now generates 3-5 bullet points per job
- No more empty job listings

---

### **4. ✅ AI Validation**
**Status**: Already fixed in previous session!
- No more fake companies (XYZ Company, etc.)
- No more modified education
- 5-layer validation system active
