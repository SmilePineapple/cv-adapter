## 🎨 Conversion Psychology Used

### 1. **Timing**
- Show upgrade modal AFTER value delivery
- 3-second delay after first generation
- User experiences product first
- Then sees upgrade opportunity

### 2. **Scarcity & Urgency**
- "Limited time: First 1,000 users"
- "Price increases to £10 after 1,000 Pro users"
- Red color for urgent states
- Countdown mentality

### 3. **Social Proof**
- "Join 500+ professionals who upgraded"
- User avatars (visual representation)
- Testimonial: "Best £5 I've spent..."
- "Most Popular" badge

### 4. **Value Anchoring**
- "Only £0.05 per generation" (vs £5 total)
- "100 Lifetime Generations" (emphasize quantity)
- Comparison table showing Free vs Pro
- Highlight what they're missing

### 5. **Loss Aversion**
- "You've used all your free generations!"
- "Almost out of generations!"
- Progress bar showing depletion
- Red warning colors

### 6. **Risk Reversal**
- "30-Day Money-Back Guarantee"
- "No questions asked" refund policy
- Reduces purchase anxiety
- Builds trust
