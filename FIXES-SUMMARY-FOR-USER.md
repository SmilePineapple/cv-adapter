# 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied - October 27, 2025

## ✅ Issues Fixed (Deployed)

### 1. ✅ Email Triggers Now Working
**What was wrong**: First generation and limit reached emails weren't sending.

**What I fixed**:
- First generation email now only sends when `currentUsage === 0` (truly first time)
- Limit reached email only sends when user JUST hit the limit
- Added debug logging so you can see in Vercel logs when emails are sent

**Test it**: Create a new account, generate 2 CVs, check your email inbox.

---

### 2. ✅ Upgrade Modal Fixed
**What was wrong**: Users were asked to upgrade after 1st CV instead of 2nd.

**What I fixed**:
- Changed logic to allow 2 free generations (not 1)
- Now correctly blocks on the 3rd attempt, not the 2nd

**How it works now**:
- 1st CV: ✅ Allowed (count = 0)
- 2nd CV: ✅ Allowed (count = 1)
- 3rd CV: ❌ Blocked (count = 2, shows upgrade modal)

**Test it**: Create new account, generate 2 CVs (should work), try 3rd (should show upgrade).

### 3. ✅ Language Override Fixed
**What was wrong**: Selected English but CV generated in Czech.

**What I fixed**:
- API now uses your selected `output_language` instead of auto-detected language
- Added logging to show which language is being used

**How it works now**:
1. CV uploaded → Auto-detects language (e.g., Czech)
2. You select "English" from dropdown
3. AI generates in English (not Czech)

**Test it**: Upload any CV, select English from dropdown, generate → should be in English.

---

### 4. ✅ Admin Dashboard Fixed
**What was wrong**: New signups not showing in advanced analytics.

**What I fixed**:
- Fixed API to use correct database table (`usage_tracking` instead of non-existent `profiles`)
- Real-time metrics now update correctly

**Test it**: Go to `/admin/dashboard`, refresh, should see updated metrics.

---

### 5. ⏳ Welcome Email (Needs Configuration)
**What's wrong**: Welcome email not sent (only confirmation email).

**Why**: Supabase Auth webhook not configured yet.

**What you need to do**: 
1. Open `WELCOME-EMAIL-SETUP.md` (I created this file)
2. Follow the 5-minute setup instructions
3. Configure webhook in Supabase Dashboard

**Quick steps**:
- Go to Supabase → Authentication → Hooks
- Add webhook: `https://mycvbuddy.com/api/webhooks/auth`
- Event: `user.created`
- Save

### 6. ⚠️ Czech Language Detection (Needs Improvement)
**What's wrong**: English CV detected as Czech.

**Why**: Language detection library can misidentify short text.

**Temporary fix**: Use the language dropdown to override (now works correctly after fix #3).

**Permanent fix needed**: Improve detection confidence threshold (I can do this if you want).
