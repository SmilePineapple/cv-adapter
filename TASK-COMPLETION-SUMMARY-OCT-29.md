### 2. ✅ Cron Job Issue Diagnosed & Fixed

#### Problem Identified
The cron job was set to run at `14:00 UTC` (2:00 PM UTC), but you expected it at 2:00 PM **local time**. This is a timezone mismatch issue.

#### Root Cause
```json
"schedule": "0 14 * * *"  // 2:00 PM UTC only
```

This means:
- **UK (GMT)**: Runs at 2:00 PM ✅
- **UK (BST)**: Runs at 3:00 PM ❌ (1 hour late)
- **US EST**: Runs at 9:00 AM ❌ (5 hours early)
- **US PST**: Runs at 6:00 AM ❌ (8 hours early)

#### Solution Implemented
Changed to run **every hour**:
```json
"schedule": "0 * * * *"  // Every hour at minute 0
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No timezone confusion
- ✅ Posts published within 1 hour of scheduled time
- ✅ Works across all timezones
- ✅ Handles DST changes automatically
- ✅ More flexible for different posting times

#### Files Modified
- `vercel.json` - Updated cron schedule

---

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Deploy to Vercel
The cron schedule change requires a new deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new blog post and fix cron schedule to run hourly"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy and update the cron job.

### 2. Verify Cron is Working

#### Check in Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Deployments" → "Functions"
4. Find `/api/social-bot/cron`
5. Check logs to see executions

#### Manual Test:
```bash
curl -X GET https://www.mycvbuddy.com/api/social-bot/cron
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Processed X posts",
  "results": {
    "checked": X,
    "posted": Y,
    "failed": 0,
    "errors": []
  }
}
```

### 3. Verify Posts Are Scheduled

Check database in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check scheduled posts for today
SELECT 
  id, 
  platform, 
  LEFT(content, 50) as content_preview,
  scheduled_for,
  posted,
  posted_at
FROM social_media_posts
WHERE scheduled_for::date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY scheduled_for;

-- Check platform configuration
SELECT 
  platform, 
  enabled, 
  posting_enabled,
  daily_post_limit,
  posts_today,
  CASE WHEN api_key IS NOT NULL THEN '✅ Set' ELSE '❌ Missing' END as api_key,
  CASE WHEN access_token IS NOT NULL THEN '✅ Set' ELSE '❌ Missing' END as access_token
FROM social_media_config;
```

### 4. Generate Posts if Needed

If no posts are scheduled, generate them:

1. Visit: https://www.mycvbuddy.com/admin/social-bot
2. Click "Generate Week" for Twitter
3. Click "Generate Week" for LinkedIn
4. Posts will be scheduled automatically

### 5. Enable Posting for Platforms

If platforms are not enabled for posting:

```sql
UPDATE social_media_config 
SET posting_enabled = true 
WHERE platform IN ('twitter', 'linkedin');
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "No posts to publish"
**Cause**: No posts scheduled for current time or earlier  
**Fix**: Generate posts in admin dashboard

### Issue: "Platform not enabled for posting"
**Cause**: `posting_enabled = false`  
**Fix**: 
```sql
UPDATE social_media_config 
SET posting_enabled = true 
WHERE platform = 'twitter';
```

### Issue: "Daily limit reached"
**Cause**: Already posted max posts today  
**Fix**: Increase limit or wait until tomorrow:
```sql
UPDATE social_media_config 
SET daily_post_limit = 20 
WHERE platform = 'twitter';
```

### Issue: Twitter API Error
**Cause**: Invalid or expired credentials  
**Fix**: Check credentials in `.env.local` and update database:
```sql
UPDATE social_media_config 
SET 
  api_key = 'your_key',
  api_secret = 'your_secret',
  access_token = 'your_token',
  access_token_secret = 'your_token_secret'
WHERE platform = 'twitter';
```
