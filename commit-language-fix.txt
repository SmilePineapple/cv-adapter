fix: Improve language detection accuracy to prevent false positives

Implemented Option 1 from IMPROVE-LANGUAGE-DETECTION.md:

1. Increased minimum text length from 50 to 200 characters
   - Requires more text for accurate detection
   - Defaults to English for short text

2. Adjusted confidence thresholds
   - High confidence: 1000+ characters (was 200+)
   - Medium confidence: 500-1000 characters (was 100-200)
   - Low confidence: 200-500 characters (was <100)

3. Default to English for low-confidence non-English detections
   - Prevents false positives (e.g., English CVs detected as Czech)
   - Only trusts non-English detection if confidence is medium or high

4. Added debug logging
   - Shows detected language, confidence, and text length
   - Helps troubleshoot detection issues

This should fix the issue where English CVs were incorrectly detected as Czech.
