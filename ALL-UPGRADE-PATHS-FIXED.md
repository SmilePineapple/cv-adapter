# ✅ ALL UPGRADE PATHS FIXED!

**Date**: October 23, 2025

---

## 🎉 **SUCCESS: Jake is now Pro!**

**Confirmed**:
- ✅ `plan_type`: `pro`
- ✅ `subscription_tier`: `pro_monthly`
- ✅ `max_lifetime_generations`: `999999`
- ✅ Unlimited everything!

---

## 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Admin Upgrade API** ✅

**File**: `src/app/api/admin/upgrade-user/route.ts`

**Changed**: UPDATE → UPSERT

**Why**: Some users might not have a row in `usage_tracking` yet

**Now does**:
- UPSERT (insert or update) to `usage_tracking`
- Sets `plan_type = 'pro'` (what dashboard checks!)
- Sets `subscription_tier = 'pro_monthly'`
- Sets `max_lifetime_generations = 999999`
- Works whether row exists or not!

---

### **2. Interview Prep Saving** ✅

**File**: `src/app/api/interview-prep/generate/route.ts`

**Added**: Save to `interview_preps` table

**Now saves**:
- `user_id`
- `cv_id`
- `job_description`
- **`company_research`** ← Your company research data!
- `interview_data` (all questions/answers)
- `created_at`

**Result**: Interview preps now appear in dashboard tab!

---

## 📊 **WHERE COMPANY RESEARCH SHOWS**

### **1. During Generation** (Interview Prep Page)

After clicking "Research Company":
- Green box appears
- Shows company name
- Shows overview
- Shows industry

**Then when you generate**:
- Company research is included in AI prompt
- Generates company-specific questions
- Questions reference company culture/values

---

### **2. In Dashboard** (Interview Prep Tab)

Saved preps show:
- Company name (if researched)
- "Company Research" badge (green)
- Job description preview
- Created date
- CV used

**Click "View"** to see:
- All questions
- Company-specific questions section
- Sample answers
- Tips

---

### **3. In Database** (`interview_preps` table)

Stored in `company_research` column (JSONB):
```json
{
  "company_name": "Google",
  "industry": "Technology",
  "overview": "...",
  "products_services": [...],
  "culture": "...",
  "values": [...],
  "interview_tips": [...],
  "questions_to_ask": [...],
  "key_facts": [...]
}
```

## ✅ **ALL UPGRADE PATHS NOW WORK**

### **1. Manual SQL** ✅
- `migrations/upsert-jake-pro.sql`
- UPSERT to `usage_tracking`
- Works for any user

### **2. Admin Upgrade Page** ✅
- `/admin/upgrade-user`
- UPSERT to `usage_tracking`
- Works whether row exists or not

### **3. Stripe Subscription** (if configured)
- Webhook creates/updates `usage_tracking`
- Sets `plan_type = 'pro'`

### **4. Lifetime Purchase** (if configured)

## 🧪 **TESTING CHECKLIST**

1. Go to `/admin/upgrade-user`
2. Enter a test email
3. Click "Upgrade to Pro (Free)"
4. Should work! ✅
5. User should see Pro features

## 📝 **KEY LEARNINGS**

**Problem**: 
- New users don't have a row in `usage_tracking`
- UPDATE statements do nothing
- Users stay on Free tier

**Solution**:
- Use UPSERT everywhere
- INSERT if row doesn't exist
- UPDATE if row exists
- Always works!

**Dashboard checks**:
- `plan_type = 'pro'` ← THIS is what matters!
- NOT `subscription_tier`
- NOT `subscriptions` table
