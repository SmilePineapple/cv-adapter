fix: Add title field and photo URL to preview/export

Fixed both remaining issues:

1. Skill Save - Title NOT NULL Constraint ✅
   - Added title: 'Skill Scores' to INSERT
   - Satisfies database constraint
   - Skills now save successfully!

2. Photo Display in Preview ✅
   - Added photoUrl to templateData
   - Preview now uses currentPhotoUrl
   - Photo shows in preview immediately!

3. Photo Display in Export ✅
   - Export API already fetches photo_url
   - Templates receive photoUrl
   - Photo appears in downloaded CV!

Changes:
- SkillScoreEditor: Add title field to insert
- Download page: Pass photoUrl to template generation

Issues Fixed:
- ❌ "title" NOT NULL constraint violation
- ❌ Photo not showing in preview
- ❌ Photo not showing in export

Status: Build passing, ready to deploy!
