UPDATE usage_tracking 
SET linkedin_imports_used = 0 
WHERE linkedin_imports_used IS NULL;
```

### **Step 2: Start Dev Server**

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Test as Free User**

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/upload`
2. Click "Import from LinkedIn"
3. Paste sample LinkedIn text (see below)
4. Click "Import from LinkedIn"
5. Should create CV and redirect to generate page

## 🎉 CELEBRATION!

**You just added**:
- ✅ LinkedIn integration
- ✅ AI-powered parsing
- ✅ Feature gating
- ✅ Beautiful UI
- ✅ Seamless UX

**This is a major competitive advantage!** 🚀

Most CV builders don't have LinkedIn import, and the ones that do require LinkedIn API access (which is hard to get). You're using AI to bypass all that!
