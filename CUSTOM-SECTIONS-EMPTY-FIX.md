# ‚úÖ CUSTOM SECTIONS EMPTY CONTENT FIX

**Date**: October 24, 2025, 11:14am  
**Issue**: Custom sections not appearing even in new generations  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED!**

---

## üêõ **ROOT CAUSE:**

The AI was being told to include custom sections, but:
1. The custom sections don't exist in the original CV
2. The AI was told to "COPY 100% EXACTLY" for custom sections
3. Since they don't exist, the AI had nothing to copy!
4. Result: AI didn't include them in the output

**The Contradiction**:
- Prompt said: "COPY custom sections 100% EXACTLY"
- Reality: Custom sections don't exist in original CV
- AI behavior: Skipped them because nothing to copy

---

## ‚úÖ **FIX APPLIED:**

### **Updated AI Prompt** (`src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts`)

**Lines 514-516**: Clarified custom section handling
```typescript
- Custom sections (volunteer_work, publications, awards, projects, languages, memberships, speaking, patents, research, teaching, community): 
  * If present in original CV: COPY 100% EXACTLY - zero modifications allowed
  * If NOT in original CV but requested: Include section with placeholder text "To be added" or leave empty
```

**Lines 553-563**: Added explicit instructions
```typescript
üö® IMPORTANT: Custom sections requested: ${customSections.join(', ')}

For each requested custom section:
1. Check if it exists in the CURRENT CV above
2. If it exists: COPY the content 100% EXACTLY
3. If it does NOT exist: Still include the section type in your output, but with empty content ""
4. This ensures the section headers appear even if no content exists yet

Example: If "volunteer_work" is requested but not in current CV:
{"type": "volunteer_work", "content": "", "order": 15, "changes": []}
```

**Lines 519-521**: Added critical warnings
```typescript
üö® CRITICAL: Experience section MUST have bullet points! Do NOT just list job titles!
üö® CRITICAL: ALL sections from original CV MUST be in output!
üö® CRITICAL: If custom sections are requested but not in original, include them as empty sections!
```

## üéØ **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

### **Scenario 1: Custom Section Exists in Original CV**
```
Original CV has:
- volunteer_work: "Volunteered at local shelter..."

AI Output:
{"type": "volunteer_work", "content": "Volunteered at local shelter...", "order": 15}
```

### **Scenario 2: Custom Section Does NOT Exist in Original CV**
```
Original CV does NOT have volunteer_work

User requests: volunteer_work

AI Output:
{"type": "volunteer_work", "content": "", "order": 15, "changes": []}
```

**Result**: Section header appears on review/download pages, but content is empty. User can manually add content later!

---

## üß™ **TESTING:**

### **Test 1: Generate New CV**
1. Go to generate page
2. Add custom sections:
   - Volunteer Work
   - Publications
   - Awards & Honors
   - Projects
   - Languages
   - Professional Memberships
   - Speaking Engagements
   - Patents
   - Research
   - Teaching Experience
   - Community Involvement
3. Click "Generate CV"
4. **Verify** on review page:
   - ‚úÖ All custom section HEADERS appear
   - ‚úÖ Sections with content in original CV show content
   - ‚úÖ Sections without content in original CV show empty (can be filled manually)

### **Test 2: Check Terminal Logs**
Look for:
```
‚úÖ Education validation passed
Custom sections requested: Volunteer Work, Publications, Awards, Projects, Languages, ...
```

### **Test 3: Verify AI Output**
The AI should return JSON with ALL requested sections:
```json
{
  "sections": [
    {"type": "name", "content": "...", "order": 1},
    {"type": "volunteer_work", "content": "", "order": 15},
    {"type": "publications", "content": "", "order": 16},
    {"type": "awards", "content": "", "order": 17},
    ...
  ]
}
```

---

## üìä **HOW IT WORKS:**

### **Generate Page ‚Üí API**
```
User adds custom sections: ["Volunteer Work", "Publications", "Awards"]
‚Üì
Generate page sends: custom_sections: ["Volunteer Work", "Publications", "Awards"]
‚Üì
API receives and passes to AI prompt
```

### **AI Processing**
```
AI reads prompt: "Custom sections requested: Volunteer Work, Publications, Awards"
‚Üì
AI checks original CV for each section
‚Üì
volunteer_work: NOT FOUND ‚Üí Include with content: ""
publications: NOT FOUND ‚Üí Include with content: ""
awards: NOT FOUND ‚Üí Include with content: ""
‚Üì
AI returns JSON with all sections (some empty)
```

### **Review/Download Pages**
```
Receives AI output with all sections
‚Üì
Renders each section dynamically
‚Üì
volunteer_work: Shows "VOLUNTEER WORK" header with empty content
publications: Shows "PUBLICATIONS" header with empty content
awards: Shows "AWARDS" header with empty content
‚Üì
User can manually edit and add content!
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTES:**

### **1. Empty Sections Are Expected**
If you add a custom section that doesn't exist in your original CV, it will appear EMPTY. This is correct behavior! You can:
- Manually add content on the review page (click Edit)
- Or upload a new CV that includes these sections with content

### **2. To Have Content in Custom Sections**
**Option A**: Upload a CV that already has these sections
- Your CV file should have sections like "Volunteer Work", "Publications", etc.
- The upload parser will extract them
- The AI will copy them exactly

**Option B**: Add content manually after generation
- Generate CV with empty custom sections
- On review page, click "Edit" for each section
- Add your content
- Click "Save Changes"

### **3. Section Name Mapping**
The generate page uses friendly names, but the AI uses underscores:
- "Volunteer Work" ‚Üí `volunteer_work`
- "Professional Memberships" ‚Üí `memberships`
- "Community Involvement" ‚Üí `community`
- "Awards & Honors" ‚Üí `awards`
- "Speaking Engagements" ‚Üí `speaking`

## üìù **FILES MODIFIED:**

### **`src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts`**
**Lines Modified**:
- Lines 514-516: Clarified custom section handling (copy if exists, empty if not)
- Lines 519-521: Added critical warnings about including requested sections
- Lines 553-563: Added explicit instructions with example

**Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed

---

## üéâ **SUMMARY:**

**Before Fix**:
```
User adds custom sections ‚Üí AI ignores them (nothing to copy) ‚Üí Sections don't appear
```

**After Fix**:
```
User adds custom sections ‚Üí AI includes them (empty if not in original) ‚Üí Sections appear with headers ‚Üí User can fill content manually
```

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIX DEPLOYED! Generate new CV to see custom section headers!**  
**Confidence**: üî• **VERY HIGH** - AI now explicitly instructed to include requested sections even if empty!
