## 📋 What Was Updated

### 1. Database Migration (`migrations/update-competition-prize.sql`)
```sql
-- Updated competition settings
- max_winners: 5 → 3
- prize_type: 'pro_1month' → 'free_generations_20'

- name: 'Monthly CV Clicker Competition'

-- New function: grant_free_generations_to_winners()
- Adds 20 to max_lifetime_generations
- Works for both Free and Pro users
- Marks prize as claimed
```

### 2. Admin Dashboard (`/admin/competition`)
- Button: "Grant Pro Access" → "Grant 20 Free Generations"
- Function: `handleGrantProAccess()` → `handleGrantFreeGenerations()`
- Logic: Adds 20 to user's `max_lifetime_generations`
- Badge: "Pro Granted" → "+20 Gens"

### 3. Competition Banner (`CompetitionBanner.tsx`)
- Title: "Win 1 Month Pro FREE!" → "Win 20 Free Generations!"

## 💰 Prize Value Comparison

### Old Prize (1 Month Pro):
- Value: £5
- Generations: 100
- Duration: 1 month
- **Issue**: Competes with launch campaign

### New Prize (20 Generations):
- Value: ~£1 (20% of Pro)
- Generations: 20
- Duration: Lifetime (added to account)
- **Benefit**: Doesn't compete with £5 offer

## 📊 Expected Impact

### User Engagement:
- **Monthly participation**: Users play every month
- **Repeat engagement**: Come back to check rankings
- **Sustained activity**: Ongoing competition vs one-time

- **3 winners**: More achievable than top 5
- **Monthly reset**: Fresh start each month
