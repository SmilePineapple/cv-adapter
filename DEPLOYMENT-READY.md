### 2. Environment Variables (Verify)
Make sure these are set in production:

```env
# OpenAI (REQUIRED)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Supabase (REQUIRED)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# Stripe (REQUIRED)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Optional

### 3. Vercel Deployment
Your code is already pushed to GitHub. Vercel will auto-deploy.

**Check:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Check deployment status
3. Verify build succeeds
4. Test production URL

---

### 4. Post-Deployment Testing

#### Critical Tests
- [ ] Upload a CV (test AI parsing)
- [ ] Generate CV (test optimized prompt)
- [ ] Export CV (test analytics tracking)
- [ ] Test onboarding (create new account)
- [ ] Test mobile (open on phone)
- [ ] Check admin dashboard (verify user count)

#### Analytics Verification
- [ ] Check Supabase `analytics_events` table
- [ ] Verify page views are tracked
- [ ] Verify export events are tracked
- [ ] Check admin dashboard shows all users

#### Performance Checks
- [ ] Dashboard loads fast (< 1s)
- [ ] AI generation works (< 5s)
- [ ] Export works (< 3s)
- [ ] Mobile is responsive

---

## 📈 **MONITORING**

### Week 1 After Deployment
- Monitor error logs (check for AI parsing errors)
- Check analytics events (verify tracking works)
- Monitor AI costs (should be 50% lower)
- Check query performance (should be 3-5x faster)
- Get user feedback on onboarding

### Week 2-4
- A/B test onboarding flow
- Optimize based on analytics
- Monitor mobile usage
- Check conversion rates

---

## 🐛 **KNOWN ISSUES**

### Minor (Non-blocking)
1. **TypeScript Warning:** `Expected 2 arguments, but got 1` in dashboard (line 650)
   - **Impact:** None - just a warning
   - **Fix:** Can be addressed later

2. **CSS Warning:** `Unknown at rule @theme`
   - **Impact:** None - Tailwind CSS warning
   - **Fix:** Can be ignored

## 📝 **ROLLBACK PLAN**

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or rollback in Vercel dashboard
# Deployments → Previous Deployment → Promote to Production
```
