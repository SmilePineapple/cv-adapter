fix: Switch to Twitter API v1.1 to work with Free tier

CRITICAL FIX: Twitter API v2 requires Elevated access for posting.
Switched to v1.1 API which works with Free tier.

Changes:
- Changed endpoint from /2/tweets to /1.1/statuses/update.json
- Changed request format from JSON to form-urlencoded
- Updated response parsing for v1.1 format
- Kept OAuth 1.0a authentication (same for both versions)

This allows posting tweets without needing Elevated access approval.
