fix: Use twitter-api-v2 library for reliable OAuth authentication

CRITICAL FIX: Our custom OAuth implementation had signature issues.
Switched to the official twitter-api-v2 library which handles OAuth correctly.

Changes:
- Added twitter-api-v2 package
- Created new twitter-api-v2.ts with library-based implementation
- Updated cron route to use new implementation
- Updated verify endpoint to use new implementation

This library is battle-tested and handles all OAuth edge cases correctly.
Should fix the "Could not authenticate you" error.
