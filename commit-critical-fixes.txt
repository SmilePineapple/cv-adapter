fix: Critical bug fixes for email triggers, language override, and admin dashboard

Fixed 5 critical issues:

1. Email triggers not firing
   - Fixed first generation email logic (check currentUsage === 0)
   - Fixed limit reached email logic (check if just hit limit)
   - Added debug logging for email sends

2. Upgrade modal showing too early
   - Fixed logic to allow 2 free generations (was blocking at 1)
   - Now correctly checks currentUsage >= maxGenerations before generation

3. Language override not working
   - Now uses output_language parameter instead of detected_language
   - Added targetLanguage variable to respect user's language selection
   - Fixed AI prompt to use correct target language

4. Admin dashboard not updating
   - Fixed real-time metrics API to use usage_tracking table instead of non-existent profiles table
   - Active users query now works correctly

5. Updated error messages
   - More accurate "limit reached" messaging
