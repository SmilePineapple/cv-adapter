feat: Add promotional banner and improve currency detection

Added two major improvements to subscription page:

1. IP-Based Currency Detection (src/app/subscription/page.tsx)
   - Replaced browser locale detection with IP-based detection
   - Uses ipapi.co API to detect user's country from IP address
   - Maps country code to appropriate currency (GB→GBP, US→USD, etc.)
   - Fallback to locale-based detection if IP detection fails
   - More accurate for VPN users and international visitors
   
   Benefits:
   - UK users will always see £ (even with US browser settings)
   - US users will always see $ (even with UK browser settings)
   - Detects actual location, not browser preference

2. Promotional Banner (src/app/subscription/page.tsx)
   - Added eye-catching gradient banner (green to blue)
   - Displays "Limited Time Offer - 50% OFF!" with star icons
   - Shows both promo codes in styled boxes:
     * LAUNCH50MONTHLY - For monthly plan
     * LAUNCH50ANNUAL - For annual plan (marked as "Best Value!")
   - Responsive design (stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)
   - Only shows for non-Pro users
   - Positioned above pricing plans for maximum visibility

Design Features:
- Gradient background (green-500 to blue-600)
- Semi-transparent white boxes with backdrop blur
- Yellow star icons for attention
- Monospace font for promo codes (easy to read/copy)
- Clear labels for each plan type

Result:
- Users immediately see promo codes before selecting plan
- No confusion about which code to use
- Accurate currency display based on actual location
- Better conversion with prominent 50% off messaging
