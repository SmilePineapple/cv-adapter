# ✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETE! 🎉

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### **1. Database Migration** ✅
**Migration:** `add-ai-improvements-tracking.sql`
**Status:** Success. No rows returned (table created successfully)

---

### **2. Free User with 2 Generations Investigation** 🔍

**Issue:** User `josegre1987@gmail.com` (Free tier) has 2 generations despite limit of 1

**Root Cause:**
- The `usage_tracking` table might not have `max_lifetime_generations` set properly for all users
- New users created before the lifetime payment migration may have incorrect limits
- The `handle_new_user()` trigger doesn't explicitly set `max_lifetime_generations`

**Solution Created:**
- **File:** `migrations/fix-free-user-limits.sql`
- Ensures all free users have `max_lifetime_generations = 1`
- Syncs `lifetime_generation_count` with `generation_count`
- Includes diagnostic queries to check specific user and all free users

**To Fix:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- migrations/fix-free-user-limits.sql
```

**What it does:**
1. Adds missing columns if they don't exist
2. Sets `max_lifetime_generations = 1` for all free users
3. Syncs lifetime counts with generation counts
4. Shows diagnostic info for the specific user
5. Lists all free users with their generation counts

### **4. Fixed JSON/HTML Display on Review Page** ✅

**Issue:** AI-generated content showing as JSON objects instead of formatted text

**Example of Problem:**
```json
{
  "dates": "October 2016 - Present",
  "title": "Service Lead for Schools",
  "bullets": [
    "Led the design and implementation...",
    "Conducted over 150 impactful..."
  ]
}
```

**Solution:**
Enhanced `formatSectionContent()` function to properly parse structured data:

**New Features:**
- ✅ Handles structured objects with `title`, `dates`, `bullets`
- ✅ Formats as readable text: "Title | Company | Dates"
- ✅ Displays bullets with proper bullet points (•)
- ✅ Handles arrays of responsibilities
- ✅ Extracts meaningful content from objects
- ✅ Fallback to readable key-value pairs (not JSON)

**After Fix:**
```
Service Lead for Schools | Child in Mind, Manchester | October 2016 - Present
• Led the design and implementation of tailored communication and therapy resources
• Conducted over 150 impactful 1:1 Play Therapy and Family Therapy sessions
• Collaborated closely with teachers and therapists to create accessible methods
```
