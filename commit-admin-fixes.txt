fix: Use service role for admin operations and improve real-time metrics

Fixed two critical admin issues:

1. Promo Blast Failing
   - Now uses service role client for auth.admin.listUsers()
   - Fixed "User not allowed" error
   - Can now fetch all users and send emails

2. Admin Dashboard Real-Time Metrics
   - Now uses service role for all admin queries
   - Increased active user window from 5 to 30 minutes
   - Fixed signups today count (was always 0)
   - All metrics now show real data

Both endpoints now properly use SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY for admin operations.
