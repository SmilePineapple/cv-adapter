```

## ‚úÖ **Verification**

### Check Indexes Were Created
```sql
-- List all indexes on cvs table
SELECT indexname, indexdef 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'cvs';

-- Should see:
-- idx_cvs_user_id_created
-- idx_cvs_last_accessed
-- idx_cvs_detected_language
```

### Check Soft Deletes Were Added
```sql
-- Check if deleted_at column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'cvs' 
  AND column_name = 'deleted_at';

-- Should return: deleted_at | timestamp with time zone
```

### Check Functions Were Created
```sql
-- List all custom functions
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
  AND routine_type = 'FUNCTION';

-- Should see:
-- cleanup_deleted_data
-- restore_deleted_cv
```

---

## üîÑ **Maintenance**

### Monthly Cleanup (Recommended)
```sql
-- Run this once a month to permanently delete old soft-deleted items
SELECT cleanup_deleted_data();
```

### Restore a Deleted CV
```sql
-- Restore a specific CV by ID
SELECT restore_deleted_cv('cv-id-here');
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Backup First:** Always backup your database before running migrations
2. **Test in Development:** Test migrations in a development environment first
3. **Monitor Performance:** Check query performance after adding indexes
4. **Schedule Cleanup:** Set up a monthly cron job to run `cleanup_deleted_data()`

---

## üìä **Expected Performance Improvements**

### Before Indexes
```sql
-- Dashboard query (slow)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM generations 
WHERE user_id = 'user-id' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Result: ~50-100ms (Seq Scan)
```

### After Indexes
```sql
-- Dashboard query (fast)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM generations 
WHERE user_id = 'user-id' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Result: ~5-10ms (Index Scan)
```

**Improvement: 5-10x faster!**

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### Error: "relation already exists"
**Solution:** Index already exists, skip this migration

### Error: "column already exists"
**Solution:** Soft delete column already exists, skip this migration

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the Supabase SQL Editor (has admin permissions)
