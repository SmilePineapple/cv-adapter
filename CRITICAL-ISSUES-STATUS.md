# 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES - STATUS UPDATE

## Issue 1: Generations Deleted When CV Deleted ⏳

**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED - Needs Manual Action

**What Was Done:**
- ✅ Migration SQL created: `migrations/fix-generation-cascade-delete.sql`
- ✅ Dashboard message updated
- ✅ Code deployed

**What's Needed:**
- ⏳ **MANUAL STEP:** Run migration in Supabase SQL Editor
- ⏳ Test by deleting a CV and verifying generation persists

**Why Manual:**
- Database schema changes require direct SQL execution
- Cannot be done through application code
- Must be run by admin in Supabase dashboard

**How to Fix:**
1. Go to Supabase → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `migrations/fix-generation-cascade-delete.sql`
3. Click "Run"
4. Verify: `delete_rule` should be `SET NULL` not `CASCADE`

## Issue 2: AI Creating Fake Jobs ✅ FIXED (WITH VALIDATION)

**Status:** FIXED - Validation Added

**Problem:**
- AI was creating "Research Integrity Content Coordinator at Springer Nature"
- Original: "Play Therapist at Child in Mind"
- This is FRAUD - inventing fake work history

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Enhanced prompt with 🚨 warnings
- ✅ Added strict validation to REJECT fake companies
- ✅ Extracts original companies dynamically
- ✅ Rejects if "Springer Nature" or similar detected
- ✅ Rejects if <70% of companies preserved

**How It Works:**
```
1. User uploads CV with "Play Therapist | Child in Mind"
2. AI generates tailored version
3. Validation checks:
   - ✅ Is "Child in Mind" still present?
   - ❌ Is "Springer Nature" present? (REJECT!)
   - ✅ Are 70%+ companies preserved?
4. If validation fails → Error message, user retries
5. If validation passes → CV generated successfully
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- First attempt: AI might try to invent fake company
- Validation: REJECTS with error
- User clicks "Generate" again
- Second attempt: AI follows rules (different seed)
- Validation: PASSES
- Result: Real companies preserved

**Error Messages:**
- "AI generated invalid content - invented fake companies (Springer Nature). Please try again."
- "AI removed too many original companies. Please try again."

## Issue 3: AI Improvements Decreasing ATS Score ⏳

**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED - Still Monitoring

**Problem:**
- AI review suggests improvements
- User applies improvements
- ATS score DECREASES (63% → 45%)
- Safeguard rejects changes (correct)
- But user frustrated - improvements should improve!

**Root Cause:**
- AI review suggests "add keywords"
- But when applying, AI REMOVES existing keywords
- Net result: Score decreases

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. ✅ Enhanced apply-improvements prompt
   - "ADD keywords, don't REMOVE"
   - "PRESERVE all existing keywords"
   - "ATS score MUST increase"

2. ✅ Safeguard working correctly
   - Rejects changes if score decreases
   - Prevents bad CV from being saved

**Current Status:**
- Prompt enhanced (deployed)
- Validation working (deployed)
- Still seeing decreases in production

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor if validation helps
- May need to add keyword preservation check
- Consider showing user which keywords were removed

## Summary

| Issue | Status | Action Needed |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Generations Deleted | ⏳ Needs Manual SQL | Run migration in Supabase |
| Fake Companies | ✅ Fixed | Test and verify |
| ATS Score Decrease | ⏳ Monitoring | Watch production logs |

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Generation Deletion
- [ ] Run migration SQL in Supabase
- [ ] Upload CV
- [ ] Generate tailored version
- [ ] Delete original CV
- [ ] Verify generation still exists
- [ ] Check `cv_id` is NULL

### Test 2: Fake Companies
- [ ] Upload Pamela's CV (Play Therapist)
- [ ] Generate for "Research Coordinator" role
- [ ] **Expected:** Error if fake company detected
- [ ] Click "Generate" again
- [ ] **Expected:** Success with real companies
- [ ] Verify: "Play Therapist | Child in Mind" preserved

### Test 3: ATS Score
- [ ] Generate CV (e.g., 63% score)
- [ ] Get AI review
- [ ] Apply improvements
- [ ] **Expected:** Score improves (63% → 73%)
- [ ] **Not Expected:** Score decreases (63% → 45%)
- [ ] Check console logs for keyword preservation

## Deployment Status

✅ **All code changes deployed**

**Commits:**
1. `CRITICAL: Fix CASCADE delete - preserve generations`
2. `Fix AI improvements (preserve keywords), auto-close modal, restore templates`
3. `CRITICAL: Add validation to reject fake companies`

**Vercel:** Live in production

**Manual Steps Required:**
1. ⏳ Run migration SQL in Supabase (Issue #1)

## Known Limitations

### Fake Company Detection
- Currently checks for specific fake companies
- May not catch all variations
- Relies on regex pattern matching
- Could have false positives

### ATS Score Improvements
- AI behavior not 100% predictable
- Prompt engineering has limits
- May need multiple attempts
- Safeguard prevents bad CVs but doesn't fix root cause

### Generation Deletion
- Migration must be run manually
- Existing orphaned generations (if any) will have NULL cv_id
- No automatic cleanup of old orphaned generations

## Recommendations

### Short Term (This Week)
1. **CRITICAL:** Run migration SQL immediately
2. Test fake company validation thoroughly
3. Monitor ATS score improvement success rate
4. Collect user feedback on "try again" experience

### Medium Term (Next Sprint)
1. Add automatic retry logic (3 attempts)
2. Improve AI prompt with more examples
3. Add keyword diff view to show what changed
4. Consider fine-tuning model on good examples

### Long Term (Future)
1. Train custom model for CV adaptation
2. Add user feedback loop for AI quality
3. Implement A/B testing for prompts
4. Build CV quality scoring system

## Support Information

### If User Reports Fake Companies
1. Check console logs for validation errors
2. Verify validation is running
3. Ask user to try generating again
4. If persists after 3 attempts, escalate

### If User Reports Deleted Generations
1. Check if migration was run
2. Verify `delete_rule` is `SET NULL`
3. Check for orphaned generations (cv_id IS NULL)
4. Restore from backup if needed

### If User Reports ATS Decrease
1. Check console logs for keyword changes
2. Verify safeguard rejected changes
3. Explain that safeguard protected their CV
4. Suggest manual editing instead
