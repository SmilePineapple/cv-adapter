feat: Add comprehensive analytics tracking system

Implemented complete user journey and funnel analysis:

Database Schema (setup-analytics-tracking.sql):
- analytics_events table for all user events
- user_sessions for session tracking
- funnel_stages for conversion funnel
- user_cohorts for cohort analysis
- feature_usage for feature adoption
- Views: conversion_funnel, cohort_retention, feature_adoption_rates, daily_active_users
- Helper functions: track_funnel_stage, update_feature_usage, initialize_user_cohort

Analytics Utility Enhancements:
- Added trackFunnelStage() for conversion tracking
- Added trackFeatureUsage() for feature adoption
- Added getConversionFunnel() for admin dashboard
- Added getCohortRetention() for retention analysis
- Added getFeatureAdoptionRates() for usage stats
- Added getDailyActiveUsers() for DAU metrics

Integration:
- Dashboard page view tracking
- Upload API: first_cv_upload funnel stage
- Rewrite API: first_generation funnel stage
- All tracking is async and non-blocking

Documentation:
- ANALYTICS-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md with complete status and next steps

Next Steps:
1. Run migrations/setup-analytics-tracking.sql in Supabase
2. Add export tracking (first_export funnel stage)
3. Add pricing page tracking (upgrade_viewed)
4. Build analytics dashboard with visualizations
