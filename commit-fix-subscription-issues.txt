fix: Critical subscription page and admin fixes

Fixed 3 critical issues:

1. Admin Page - Free generations display
   - Changed "1/1" to "2/2" for free users
   - File: src/app/admin/page.tsx (line 420)

2. Subscription Page - Plan selection bug
   - Both Monthly and Annual buttons were calling same function without plan parameter
   - Annual button was redirecting to monthly checkout
   - Fixed: Added plan parameter to handleUpgrade() function
   - Monthly button: onClick={() => handleUpgrade('monthly')}
   - Annual button: onClick={() => handleUpgrade('annual')}
   - File: src/app/subscription/page.tsx

3. Stripe Coupon Error
   - Removed broken STRIPE_DEFAULT_COUPON logic
   - Error: "No such coupon: 'LAUNCH50MONTHLY'"
   - Simplified to: sessionParams.allow_promotion_codes = true
   - Users can now enter promo codes manually at checkout
   - Removed "50% OFF with code LAUNCH50ANNUAL" from UI
   - Changed to "BEST VALUE - Save £70/year"
   - File: src/app/api/stripe/create-checkout/route.ts

All subscription flows now work correctly:
- Monthly plan: £9.99/month
- Annual plan: £49/year (£4.08/month)
- Users can enter promo codes at Stripe checkout
