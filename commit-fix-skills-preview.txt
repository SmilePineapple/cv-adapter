fix: Fix skills not updating and preview contact info display

CRITICAL FIXES:

1. Skills Not Updating ✅
   Problem: Skill names had malformed JSON brackets
   - Database: `{ name: '["Exceptional communication skills"', level: 65 }`
   - Root Cause: SkillScoreEditor was using JSON.stringify on arrays
   - Result: Skill names had brackets, couldn't match for level lookup
   
   Solution:
   - Fixed SkillScoreEditor.tsx to handle arrays properly
   - Check if content is array first, map directly
   - Only split string content, never stringify arrays
   - Clean skill names: `{ name: 'Exceptional communication skills', level: 65 }`
   
   Impact:
   ✅ Skill scores save with clean names
   ✅ getSkillLevel() can now match skills correctly
   ✅ Custom skill levels will display in templates
   ✅ Both preview and export will show correct levels

2. Preview Not Showing Contact Info ✅
   Problem: Export showed contact info, preview didn't
   Root Cause: Preview wasn't normalizing field names
   - Database has: phone_number, email_address, address, web
   - Templates expect: phone, email, location, website
   - Export API normalized, preview didn't
   
   Solution:
   - Added same normalization logic to preview
   - Maps email_address→email, phone_number→phone, etc.
   - Now preview matches export exactly
   
   Impact:
   ✅ Preview shows phone, email, location, website
   ✅ Preview matches exported PDF
   ✅ WYSIWYG - what you see is what you get

3. Added skillScores to Preview ✅
   Problem: Preview wasn't passing skillScores to templates
   Solution: Fetch skill_scores section and pass to templateData
   Impact: Preview will now show custom skill levels

Changes Made:
- src/components/SkillScoreEditor.tsx:
  * Fixed skill loading to handle arrays without stringify
  * Check Array.isArray() first
  * Map array items directly to strings
  * Only split if string content
  
- src/app/download/[id]/page.tsx:
  * Added contact field normalization (same as export)
  * Added skillScores to templateData
  * Preview now matches export exactly

Impact:
✅ Skills update correctly in preview and export
✅ Contact info shows in preview
✅ Custom skill levels display
✅ No more malformed skill names
✅ Preview = Export (WYSIWYG)

Remaining Issues:
- Social bot not auto-posting (need to check Vercel cron logs)
- Sidebar icon alignment (template design issue)

Status: Build passing, ready to deploy!
