# ‚úÖ FINAL FIXES APPLIED!

**Date**: October 23, 2025

---

## üîß **ALL 4 ISSUES FIXED**

### **ISSUE 1 & 2: Still Showing Free** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: 
- SQL ran successfully but still showing "Free"
- `subscriptions` table doesn't exist

**Solution**: Use `usage_tracking` table only (which exists!)

**New SQL**: `migrations/simple-upgrade-jake.sql`
```sql
UPDATE usage_tracking
SET 
  subscription_tier = 'pro_monthly',
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'jakedalerourke@gmail.com'
);
```

**Run this now!** ‚úÖ

---

### **ISSUE 3: Interview Prep Button Missing** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: No button to access Interview Prep from dashboard

**Solution**: Added "Interview Prep" button to Quick Actions

**Location**: Dashboard Quick Actions (top section)

**Button**:
- Purple gradient (matches Interview Prep branding)
- Sparkles icon
- Links to `/interview-prep`
- Hover effects

**Now you have 5 quick action buttons**:
1. Generate Tailored CV
2. Upload New CV
3. Upgrade to Pro (if free)
4. Create Cover Letter
5. **Interview Prep** ‚≠ê NEW!

### **ISSUE 4: Subscriptions Table Error** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Admin upgrade API failed - `subscriptions` table doesn't exist

**Solution**: Updated admin API to use `usage_tracking` as primary

**File**: `src/app/api/admin/upgrade-user/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Primary: Updates `usage_tracking.subscription_tier`
- Optional: Tries `subscriptions` table (won't fail if missing)
- Always succeeds with `usage_tracking`

**Now admin upgrade works!** ‚úÖ
