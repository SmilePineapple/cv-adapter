fix: Apply skillScores fix to ALL 5 stunning templates

SUCCESS! Teal Sidebar works, now fixing the other 4 templates.

Applied the same skillScores logic to:
1. ✅ Professional Metrics
2. ✅ Teal Sidebar (already working)
3. ✅ Soft Header (FIXED)
4. ✅ Artistic Header (FIXED)
5. ✅ Bold Split (FIXED)

All templates now:
- Check if skillScores exists and has data
- Use skillScores.map(s => s.name) for skill names
- Fall back to extractSkills(data.skills) if no skillScores
- Log which source is being used for debugging

Console logs added for each template:
- 🎯 [Template]: Using skillScores for skill names
- 📝 [Template]: Using extracted skills from text
- ✨ [Template]: Final skills array

Impact:
✅ All 5 templates now use custom skill names
✅ Custom skill levels display correctly
✅ Skills match what user sets in editor
✅ No more mismatch between templates

Testing:
1. Select any template
2. Adjust skills
3. Click Save
4. Preview auto-refreshes
5. Skills show correct names and levels

Status: Build passing, ready to deploy!
