**Recommended Response:**
```
Keith, you're absolutely right - and that's exactly why we built CV Adapter. 

When there are 200+ applicants for one role, your CV needs to do TWO things:
1️⃣ Get past the ATS (92% of companies use them)
2️⃣ Stand out to the hiring manager in the 6 seconds they spend reviewing

A "perfect" CV that gets filtered out by ATS never reaches human eyes. That's the problem we're solving - ensuring your CV is both ATS-optimized AND compelling to humans.

You're right that market conditions matter, but we can't control the job market. What we CAN control is making sure your application gets seen when opportunities do arise.

What's been your experience with ATS systems in your hiring process?
```

- `LINKEDIN-RESPONSE-KEITH.md` - Response options and strategy
