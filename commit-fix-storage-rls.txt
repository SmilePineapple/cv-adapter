fix: Add SQL migration to fix photo upload and skill save errors

Created comprehensive fix for storage and RLS issues:

1. Storage Bucket Creation ✅
   - Creates cv-assets bucket
   - 5MB file size limit
   - Allowed types: JPEG, JPG, PNG, WebP
   - Public read access

2. Storage Policies ✅
   - Users can upload to cv-photos/ folder
   - Public read access
   - Users can update/delete own photos
   - Proper authentication checks

3. cv_sections RLS Policies ✅
   - Fixed 406 errors
   - Users can SELECT own sections
   - Users can INSERT own sections
   - Users can UPDATE own sections
   - Users can DELETE own sections
   - All policies check cvs.user_id = auth.uid()

Issues Fixed:
- ❌ "Bucket not found" error
- ❌ 406 status on cv_sections
- ❌ Failed to upload photo
- ❌ Failed to save skill levels

Files Created:
- migrations/fix-storage-and-rls.sql (complete migration)
- FIX-PHOTO-SKILL-ERRORS.md (detailed guide)

Next Steps:
1. Run migration in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Test photo upload
3. Test skill save
4. Both should work!

Status: Migration ready to run!
