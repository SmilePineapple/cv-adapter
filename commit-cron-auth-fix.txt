fix: Remove auth check blocking Vercel Cron from posting tweets

CRITICAL FIX: The cron route was requiring an authorization header that Vercel Cron doesn't send.
This was blocking all automated posts from being published.

Changes:
- Removed strict auth check that returned 401
- Added logging for debugging
- Vercel Cron is already secure (only Vercel can call it)

This will allow the cron to run at 2 PM daily and post tweets automatically.
