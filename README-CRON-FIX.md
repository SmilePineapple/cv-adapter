# 🔧 Cron Job Fix - Quick Reference

## 🎯 Problem
Cron job scheduled for 2:00 PM didn't post at 2:28 PM.

## 🔍 Root Cause
**Timezone mismatch!** Cron was set to `14:00 UTC`, not your local time.

## ✅ Solution
Changed from **once daily** to **every hour**:

```json
// Before (runs once at 2 PM UTC only)
"schedule": "0 14 * * *"

// After (runs every hour)
"schedule": "0 * * * *"
```

## 📋 What This Means

### Old Behavior:
- Ran once per day at 2:00 PM UTC
- If you're in UK (BST), that's 3:00 PM local
- If you're in US EST, that's 9:00 AM local
- Missed posts scheduled for other times

### New Behavior:
- Runs every hour at minute :00
- Posts published within 1 hour of scheduled time
- Works in all timezones
- More flexible for different posting times

## 🚀 Deploy Instructions

```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix cron schedule and add new blog post"

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 3. Vercel will auto-deploy
# Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

# 4. Verify in Vercel Dashboard
# Go to: Deployments → Functions → /api/social-bot/cron
```

## 🧪 Test Immediately

### Quick Test:
```powershell
# Test the endpoint
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://www.mycvbuddy.com/api/social-bot/cron" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "No posts to publish",  // or "Processed X posts"
  "results": {
    "checked": 0,
    "posted": 0,
    "failed": 0,
    "errors": []
  }
}
```

## ✅ Checklist Before It Works

- [ ] Posts are scheduled in database
- [ ] Platforms are enabled (`posting_enabled = true`)
- [ ] API credentials are configured
- [ ] Daily limits not exceeded
- [ ] Code deployed to Vercel

## 📊 Check Database

### Are posts scheduled?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM social_media_posts 
WHERE posted = false 
AND scheduled_for <= NOW();
```

### Are platforms enabled?
```sql
SELECT platform, enabled, posting_enabled 
FROM social_media_config;
```

### Enable if needed:
```sql
UPDATE social_media_config 
SET posting_enabled = true 
WHERE platform = 'twitter';
```

## 🎨 Generate Posts

1. Visit: https://www.mycvbuddy.com/admin/social-bot
2. Click "Generate Week" for Twitter
3. Click "Generate Week" for LinkedIn
4. Posts will be scheduled automatically

## ⏰ When Will It Post?

- Cron runs **every hour** at minute :00
- If post scheduled for 2:15 PM, it posts at 3:00 PM
- If post scheduled for 2:45 PM, it posts at 3:00 PM
- If post scheduled for 3:00 PM, it posts at 3:00 PM

## 📈 Monitor

### Vercel Logs:
1. Vercel Dashboard
2. Functions → `/api/social-bot/cron`
3. View execution logs

### Database Check:
```sql
-- See recent posts
SELECT platform, content, posted_at, post_url
FROM social_media_posts
WHERE posted = true
ORDER BY posted_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "No posts to publish" | Generate posts in admin dashboard |
| "Platform not enabled" | Run `UPDATE social_media_config SET posting_enabled = true` |
| "Daily limit reached" | Increase limit or reset `posts_today = 0` |
| "API error" | Check credentials in `.env.local` and database |
