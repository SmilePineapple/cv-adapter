fix: Dynamic currency display on subscription page

Fixed mixed currency display issue (£ and $ showing together):

1. Currency Config Enhancement (src/lib/currency.ts)
   - Added annual pricing fields to CurrencyConfig interface:
     * annualAmount: Annual price in smallest unit
     * annualDisplayAmount: Formatted annual price (e.g., "£49", "$69")
     * annualMonthlyEquivalent: Monthly equivalent (e.g., "£4.08/month")
     * annualSavings: Savings text (e.g., "Save £70/year")
   
   - Updated all 6 currencies with annual pricing:
     * GBP: £49/year (save £70)
     * USD: $69/year (save $87)
     * EUR: €59/year (save €73)
     * CAD: C$79/year (save C$101)
     * AUD: A$89/year (save A$103)
     * INR: ₹4,999/year (save ₹7,000)

2. Subscription Page Fixes (src/app/subscription/page.tsx)
   - Free plan: Changed "£0" to dynamic "{userCurrency.symbol}0"
   - Free plan: Updated "1 CV generation" to "2 free CV generations"
   - Annual plan: Changed hardcoded "£49" to "{userCurrency.annualDisplayAmount}"
   - Annual plan: Changed "£4.08/month" to "{userCurrency.annualMonthlyEquivalent}"
   - Annual plan: Changed "Save £70/year" to "{userCurrency.annualSavings}"

Result:
- UK users see: £0, £9.99/month, £49/year (Save £70/year)
- US users see: $0, $12.99/month, $69/year (Save $87/year)
- All prices now consistent with user's detected currency
- No more mixed £ and $ on same page!
