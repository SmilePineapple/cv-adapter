fix: Resolve dashboard syntax error with fragment wrapper

Fixed JSX syntax error in dashboard overview tab:
- Added React fragment wrapper (<>...</>)
- Allows PhotoUpload section alongside grid layout
- Resolves "Expected '</>', got '{'" build error

Changes:
- Wrapped overview tab content in fragment
- PhotoUpload now renders correctly
- Build error resolved

Status: Dashboard builds successfully
