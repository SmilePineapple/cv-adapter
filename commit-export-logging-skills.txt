fix: Add skill scores fetch and detailed export logging

Added comprehensive fixes and debugging for export issues:

1. Skill Scores in Export ✅
   - Fetch skill_scores from cv_sections table
   - Include in completeSections array
   - Log when custom skill scores are used
   - Skills will now update in exports!

2. Detailed Export Logging ✅
   - Log all section types being exported
   - Check if name section exists
   - Check if contact section exists
   - Log content for name/contact/education/certifications
   - Show if sections are empty or missing
   - Easier to debug "Your Name" issue

Changes:
- Fetch latestSkillScores from cv_sections
- Add skill_scores to completeSections if present
- Enhanced logging for name and contact sections
- Log critical warnings if sections missing

This will help identify:
- Why "Your Name" is showing (name section missing/empty?)
- Why contact info is empty (contact section missing/empty?)
- Whether skill scores are being fetched

Next Steps:
1. Deploy and test export
2. Check Vercel logs for section data
3. Fix based on what logs reveal

Status: Build passing, ready to deploy with debugging!
