feat: Add skill score editor to download page for skill-based templates

Implemented skill score editor placement:

1. Skill Score Editor on Download Page ✅
   - Shows before Export Format section
   - Only for templates that use skill scores:
     * Professional Metrics
     * Teal Sidebar
     * Soft Header
     * Artistic Header
     * Bold Split
   - Auto-loads skills from CV
   - Adjustable sliders (0-100%)
   - Add/remove skills
   - Save to database
   - Preview refreshes on update

2. Photo Upload Stays on Upload Page ✅
   - Shows after successful CV upload
   - Requires cvId (can't show before upload)
   - Perfect workflow timing

Features:
- Conditional rendering based on template
- Real-time preview updates
- Toast notifications
- Clean UI integration

Files Modified:
- src/app/download/[id]/page.tsx (added SkillScoreEditor)
- src/app/upload/page.tsx (kept PhotoUpload after CV upload)

Documentation:
- DASHBOARD-REDESIGN-SUMMARY.md (complete plan)

Next: Dashboard button redesign

Status: Build passing, ready to deploy!
