feat: Complete bug fixes - rate limiting and email verification

Implemented remaining critical bug fixes:

1. Rate Limiting System (src/lib/rate-limit-simple.ts)
   - Simple in-memory rate limiter (no external dependencies)
   - Pre-configured limiters: strict, normal, generous, api
   - Applied to /api/rewrite (10 requests/minute per user)
   - Proper HTTP 429 responses with Retry-After headers
   - X-RateLimit headers for client-side handling
   - Auto-cleanup of old entries
   
   Benefits:
   - Prevents API abuse
   - Protects OpenAI quota
   - Better error messages
   - Works immediately (no Redis needed)

2. Email Verification Flow (src/app/auth/verify-email/page.tsx)
   - Beautiful verification page with auto-check
   - Resend verification email button
   - Auto-redirect when verified (checks every 3 seconds)
   - Skip option for users
   - Clear instructions and status
   
   Benefits:
   - Reduces spam signups
   - Validates real users
   - Better email deliverability
   - Professional onboarding

3. Documentation
   - RATE-LIMIT-SETUP.md with upgrade path
   - Option to upgrade to Upstash Redis later
