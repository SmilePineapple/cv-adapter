fix: Fix contact info fields and work experience descriptions in all templates

CRITICAL FIXES for all 5 stunning templates based on screenshots and logs:

1. Contact Info Field Names ✅
   Problem: Templates looking for phone/email but data has phone_number/email_address
   Solution: Normalize contact field names in export API
   - email_address → email
   - phone_number → phone  
   - address → location
   - web → website
   Impact: Contact info now displays correctly in all templates

2. Work Experience Descriptions ✅
   Problem: Showing "undefined" instead of job descriptions
   Root Cause: Template parsing mismatch
   - getSectionContent formats as: "Title | Company (Dates)\nDescription"
   - Templates expected: Line[0]=Title, Line[1]=Company, Line[2+]=Description
   - Actually: Line[0]="Title | Company (Dates)", Line[1+]=Description
   Solution: Fixed all 5 templates to parse correctly
   - Professional Metrics ✅
   - Teal Sidebar ✅
   - Soft Header ✅
   - Artistic Header ✅
   - Bold Split ✅ (already correct)
   Impact: Job descriptions now display properly

3. Template-Specific Fixes ✅
   - Removed .slice(0, 2) limit from Artistic Header
   - Fixed exp-meta removal (was showing "Company" separately)
   - Unified experience parsing across all templates
   - Descriptions now show full content

Changes Made:
- src/app/api/export/route.ts:
  * Added normalizedContact object
  * Maps email_address→email, phone_number→phone, etc.
  * Passes normalized fields to templates
  
- src/lib/stunning-templates.ts:
  * Fixed all 5 templates' experience parsing
  * Changed from: exp.split('\n')[0], [1], [2+]
  * Changed to: lines[0] = titleLine, lines.slice(1) = description
  * Removed fallback text like "Position", "Company", "Description"

Impact:
✅ Contact info displays (phone, email, location, website)
✅ Work experience descriptions show properly
✅ No more "undefined" text
✅ All templates parse experience correctly
✅ Full job descriptions visible

Next: Fix sidebar icon alignment (separate CSS issue)

Status: Build passing, ready to deploy!
