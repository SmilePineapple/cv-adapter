## ⚠️ Minor Observations

### **1. Style/Tone Selection Issue**
**Problem:** Intended to test Bold style + Creative tone, but form used Balanced + Professional

**Impact:** LOW - Still got valuable test results

**Cause:** Form radio buttons didn't respond to programmatic clicks

**Recommendation:** Add `data-testid` attributes for automated testing

---

### **2. Some Descriptions May Be Stretching**

**Example:**
```
"Utilized social media platforms to share success stories and promote awareness of mental health initiatives"
```

**Analysis:**
- Therapy organizations do use social media
- This is plausible
- But may not be Pamela's actual responsibility
- ⚠️ Could be questioned in interview

**Recommendation:**
- Add note: "Review adapted descriptions carefully"
- Ensure candidate can speak to all claims

- Communication → Audience engagement

### **3. Language Matters**
Using appropriate verbs makes a huge difference:
- "Crafted" sounds creative (good for marketing)
