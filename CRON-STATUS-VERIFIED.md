## 📊 Current Platform Status

| Platform  | Enabled | Posting | Posts Today | Limit | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Twitter   | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes  | 3/10        | 10    | 🟢 Active |
| LinkedIn  | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes  | 5/5         | 5     | 🟡 Limit Reached |
| Facebook  | ✅ Yes  | ❌ No   | 0/5         | 5     | ⚪ Disabled |
| Instagram | ✅ Yes  | ❌ No   | 0/3         | 3     | ⚪ Disabled |

### Key Findings:
- **LinkedIn**: Hit daily limit (5/5) - Won't post more today
- **Twitter**: Still has capacity (3/10) - Can post 7 more today
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Not enabled for posting yet

---

## 🔄 What Happens Now?

### Automatic Posting Schedule:
- ✅ Cron runs **every hour** at minute :00
- ✅ Checks for scheduled posts
- ✅ Posts to enabled platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- ✅ Respects daily limits
- ✅ Updates database automatically

### Next Automatic Run:
- **Next execution**: Top of the next hour (e.g., 3:00 PM, 4:00 PM, etc.)
- **What it will do**: Check for any posts scheduled between now and then
- **Platforms**: Twitter (has capacity), LinkedIn (limit reached for today)

---

## 📈 Posts Scheduled

You have **2 posts** scheduled that haven't been posted yet.

### Check Scheduled Posts:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  platform,
  LEFT(content, 60) as preview,
  scheduled_for,
  posted
FROM social_media_posts
WHERE posted = false
ORDER BY scheduled_for;
```

---

## 🎯 Why Only 1 of 2 Posted?

Looking at your platform status:
- **LinkedIn**: Already at 5/5 daily limit
- **Twitter**: At 3/10 (has room)

**Most likely**: One post was for LinkedIn (hit limit), one was for Twitter (posted successfully).

### Verify:
```sql
-- Check what just posted
SELECT platform, content, posted_at, post_url
FROM social_media_posts
WHERE posted = true
ORDER BY posted_at DESC
LIMIT 2;

-- Check what's still pending
SELECT platform, content, scheduled_for, error_message
FROM social_media_posts
WHERE posted = false
ORDER BY scheduled_for
LIMIT 5;
```
