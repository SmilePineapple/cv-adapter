# üö® CRITICAL FIXES ROUND 5 - Experience, Education & AI Improvements

## Issues Identified from Screenshots

### Issue 1: Experience Getting Cut Down ‚ùå
**Problem:** 
- Original CV shows 6+ detailed work experiences with multiple bullet points each
- AI Generated version only shows 1 job with 5-6 bullets
- Losing 5+ years of work history!

**Example:**
- Original: Play Therapist (2016-2022), Play Therapist (2015-2016), Family Session Worker (2023-Present), Outreach Worker (2010-2015), Parent Support Advisor (2005-2007), Service Lead (2016-Present)
- Generated: Only showing Research Integrity Content Coordinator with generic bullets

**Root Cause:** AI was summarizing/condensing instead of preserving ALL jobs

---

### Issue 2: Education Being Replaced ‚ùå
**Problem:**
- Original: 4 specific qualifications (Filial Therapy, Psychology BSc, Play Therapy Diploma, Health & Social Care GNVQ)
- Generated: Generic "Bachelor's Degree in [Your Major]" placeholder

**Root Cause:** AI was replacing education instead of copying it exactly

---

### Issue 3: AI Improvements Decreasing ATS Score ‚ùå
**Problem:**
- Console log: `‚ö†Ô∏è ATS Score decreased by 17% - reverting to original sections`
- API returns 400 error
- Improvements rejected (safeguard working correctly)
- But comparison view never shows because improvements failed

**Root Cause:** AI improvements removing keywords, which triggers safeguard

---

### Issue 4: Comparison View Not Showing ‚ùå
**Problem:**
- Console shows: `showComparison: false, hasImprovedSections: false`
- No comparison view appears after applying improvements

**Root Cause:** API returns 400 error, so `improvedSections` stays null, comparison never triggers

---

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Enhanced Rewrite Prompt (CV Generation)

**Added to `/api/rewrite` prompt:**

```
CRITICAL RULES:
4. DO NOT SUMMARIZE OR SHORTEN: Keep ALL bullet points and details from each job - expand them, don't reduce them
5. EDUCATION MUST STAY IDENTICAL: Copy education section EXACTLY as shown - same degrees, universities, dates

FOCUS AREAS:
- Experience: For EACH job, include ALL original bullet points PLUS add 1-2 more with metrics and action verbs. NEVER reduce the number of bullet points.

```

**What This Does:**
- ‚úÖ Preserves ALL work experiences

9. CRITICAL: Maintain or IMPROVE ATS score - ensure ALL job-relevant keywords are present
10. DO NOT remove any important keywords or skills from the original CV
11. DO NOT summarize or shorten content - only enhance and expand
```

**What This Does:**
- ‚úÖ Preserves education exactly
